Gymnastics Smashes #23 ASU
Wednesday, February 11th, 2009

Last Friday was the annual Gymnastics “Pink Out” for awareness of breast and cervical cancer. I was there camera in hand ready for another performance from the women. It was immediately clear that OSU was on a different level than ASU.

Equipment:
Nikon D90
Nikkor 300mm f/2.8

Getting the Shot:
Every gymnastics meet I’ve been to I’ve shot from the floor just feet from where the gymnasts are performing. Tonight I decided to bring along the 300mm and try some shooting from up high. The reason I went with the 300mm is the clean backgrounds that I could get. When shooting low and at f/2.8 there just isn’t enough separation from the crowd, the backgrounds are too busy for my liking. After shooting the bars, floor, and beam from up in the stands I know which I prefer: The Bars. When shooting the floor it’s hard to get a sense of height from up so high, it almost looks like the gymnast are laying on the floor. From now on the floor with be shot from the floor. As for the beam I just didn’t like the length of the 300, I think sitting a little lower in the stands with a 70-200 or 80-200 would work much better. Bars was fantastic as I finally got the shot I’ve been wanting to get. Next meet looks like I’ll be bringing the 300mm and a 70-200mm along.
