The loud patter of rain hitting the earthy ground just outside the shoji screen was our alarm clock. It had begun raining in the night and continued to progress through waves of the storm. Slowing down to a mist and then intensifying back to a downpour. With no desire to walk around Hakone getting soaked by the torrential rains, I decided to take advantage of the indoor onsen. I went in once right after waking up and then again around 11. At this point the rain had slowed considerably so my Dad and I set off to explore around the village.

With hiking shoes on, backpack full of camera gear, and umbrella in hand we set out for “The Noted Area of Pampas Grass.” This is what was on the Hakone tourist map, and hell if it’s noted it’s gotta be cool. After straddling the side of a high for about 10 minutes we came to the huge clearing of pampas grass. I set up my tripod and started to snap photos as my dad, like always, set off to explore. He began climbing up the side of the hill going further and further until I could barley see him. Splat! “Here comes the rain” I thought. Quickly I packed up my gear and set off up the hill after my dad. I’m sure the sight was funny from below; two gaijin in the pampas grass, clear umbrellas opened to shield our upper bodies from the rain, slowly moving up the side of the hill.

We thought we could make out a road above so we continued upward, but the farther we went the more the trails disappeared. Still not coming upon the road we decided to stop take some more photos and head back down. After getting back to the road we set off in the direction we were originally heading, continuing our loop of the village. When we were just about out of the pampas grass clearing, which the road went through, we saw that there had in fact been a trail/road at the top of the clearing. We had been just 20 feet short of it when we decided to head back down. Laughing at our luck we stopped at a vending machine, in the middle of nowhere, to get a coke. Refreshed, we continued around the village, seeing all sorts of things you never see in Tokyo.

Later that night back at the guest house we went out for some time in the rotenburo (outdoor hot spring). The clouds had slowly eased away during the day and now we could see stars from the hot spring. There were so many compared with back in Tokyo. Getting to see the stars really put the icing on the whole trip. I went to bed having a clear mind and happy emotions.

The next day we headed back for Tokyo, I had school so we had to leave in the morning. Before leaving though I was sure to use the rotenburo one more time. While my friends back in Tokyo were still asleep I was laying in the silky white waters of Hakone.
