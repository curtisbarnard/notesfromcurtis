The Economic Collapse Explained!

I've been listening to OPB/NPR a lot lately, even now i'm listening to This American Life. They are replaying a special that is explaining the entire banking crisis in 59 minutes, and it's good, damn good. So please take a trip over there and have a listen. Become educated, and make your voice heard.
