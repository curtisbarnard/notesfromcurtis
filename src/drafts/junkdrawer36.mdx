Trip to Portland
Sunday, August 17th, 2008

I took a trip to Portland a few weeks back for my birthday and i snapped a few good pictures while i was up there. So i figured i should post them as i finally got them up on Flickr.

The next three photos are of some plants i wish to identify. If you happen to know the common name or scientific name please post a comment and tell me. Thanks!

That’s it for now. I hope you enjoyed these photos.
