I recently acquired two new lenses, a 28mm and a 85mm. I’ve been having a ball with the 28mm as it’s tack sharp and just a really nice focal length for me. This has led me to neglect the 85mm so I took it out yesterday for some sunset shots. While the lens is nowhere near as good as the 28mm I really like it. Especially after having no glass faster than f/3.5 I’m loving the f/2. I haven’t used the lens much yet, but I can definitely see that the lens gets progressively sharper at f/2.8, which is still pretty fast. In this photo from yesterday is a Sweetgum Ball in a puddle after a rainstorm. The sun had dropped behind the clouds and light was disappearing, but I have f/2 now so that’s no problem! Right after I took the photo and was satisfied I stepped in dog shit, I guess it’s the price I have to pay for more photo opportunities.
