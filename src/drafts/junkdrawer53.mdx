Last Thursday I went to the men’s basketball game against Stanford. The first half started off great with the Beavers pulling out a 20 point lead. Things got a little more sloppy in the second half and Stanford pulled to within six. In the end the Beavers prevailed and i experienced my first men’s basketball win.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8

Getting the Shot:
I decided to go back to the D300 for this game for the higer frame rate and to compare ISO performance to the D90. After shooting with the D300 i think it has better ISO performance than the D90 as i was shooting around ISO 2000 and everything looked pretty nice. I also wanted to shoot from the stands for this game, but because the team has been winning the arena is more crowded now. That left me with a traditional spot on the baseline as far from the hoop as i could get. In this photo Calvin Haynes comes in for the layup.
