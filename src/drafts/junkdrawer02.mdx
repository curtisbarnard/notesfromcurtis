Last Friday was senior night for OSU gymnastics and the final regular season meet of the year. I've posted several times before that gymnastics is one of my favorite sports to shoot, so it should come as no surprise that I was sad to see the seniors go. I've really enjoyed shooting their routines this year and last. Alas, the cycle must continue and now we have some exciting new gymnasts on the team. I look forward to seeing their progression over the next couple years.

Getting the Shot:
It's been a while since I last tried using a 50mm for gymnastics, but i was looking for a change. Let it be know that a 50mm works spectacularly well on the uneven bars. It allows me to get an aperture around f/2 or f/2.2 which helps separate the gymnast from the crowd. Plus it allows me to get low and, as in the photo for this post, put a nice non distracting background in the photo.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 D
