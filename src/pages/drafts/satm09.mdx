Brewery History and Background:
We were founded in 1885 in Senhata Village. We ceased brewing for a time during the war. In 1949 we moved operations there for searching of good water and we received the house of the first mayor of Rokugo Village Mr.Hatakeyama, In 1992 the 3rd generation president passed away without a successor, and at the request of the company the current president, Mr. Koyama, took over. We work very hard at thorough quality control, since much of what, mainly Honjozo-shu, Junmai-shu and Ginjo-shu, we send to Tokyo and other places is is Honjozo,Junmai-shu and Ginjo-shu.
Origins of the name:
The name Okushimizu comes from a combination of the mountain range from which our water comes, the Ohu mountain range, and Shimizu, meaning clean water, from the expression "the spring water village,ï¾“ referring to Rokugo Village.
