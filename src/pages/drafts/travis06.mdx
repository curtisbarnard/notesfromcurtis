Crazzzzy day.
Today has to be the craziest day I've had in Japan so far. We started off early and headed out to AGU in Shibuya. We had and orientation session and also met our tutors. Mine is an English major named Saki. She was very helpful and fun. We had lunch at the University's cafeteria. Contrary to the HUB's 7.00 rice box thing, I got a katsudon set for around 3 dollars. Katsu curry set was only 4 bucks, and it was mighty tasty.

After lunch we had a placement exam. THEN.....the fun began.

The group mobbed through shibuya over to yoyogi koen to have Hanami (flower viewing). But actually its just an excuse for the Japanese to get drunk in the middle of the day. It was around 2 or 3 in the afternoon and the Japanese students bought an unbelievable amount of snacks and beer. Tarps were laid out and the party began.

We have a midnight curfew so we had to start early. :)

My tutor Saki!

Umaibo: giant cheeto-like snacks (flavors: cow tongue, salami, corn soup)

Around 125 exchange and Japanese students

beautiful day.

Of course some person from a different group blacked out face down on their tarp and had to call and ambulence to pick the person up... keep in mind that it's still light out.

all pau!

hanahou! we continued on to a British pub called The HUB(!!!) in Shibuya for happy hour. 2 dollar gin tonics. It reminds me of college inn.

ice skating on tv in the bar? chotto hen.
