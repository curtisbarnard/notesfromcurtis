Poladroid
Saturday, February 14th, 2009

While reading through one of my favorite photography forums, fredmiranda.com, I came across a neat little program. Poladroid is a free program that takes a photo and gives it not just the Polaroid look, but also the Polaroid white border. I think a lot of people enjoy the dark colors and amateurish look of Polaroid photos. For me it’s the rawness and almost voyeuristic aspect of the photos that draws me in. I feel like i’m peeking into someone’s dark and dirty past. Now with Poladroid you can quickly and simply give your photos this feel, of course the photo before using Poladroid must be good too. There’s a famous saying that goes something like “you can cover shit up, you can give shit some pretty colors, but it’s still shit.”

Here I’ve posted two examples of what the program made. The first one is to the left and is a sunset photo I took the other day here in Corvallis. Here is a link to the original photo on flickr. The second photo is from an earlier barometer post, you can click here to read it. I think this will be fun to process some of the more street, dingy, metropolitan photos I plan to take while in Tokyo. So everyone can look forward to more Polaroid’s in the future.
