Cleaning Up
Thursday, August 21st, 2008

Now that schools out i’ve been hanging around home all day sitting on the computer. Mainly i’ve been learning kanji and i want to learn 2000 within a couple months some i’m “hitting” the books pretty hard. In my spare time i’ve been going through old photos and clearing out the bad one’s while uploading the good ones to my Flickr. Here’s some that i thought i’d share. First some photos from the OSU beavers spring game back in May and then some photos from some OSU Fashion show back in May:

Lenses used: Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8 and Nikkor 300mm f/2.8

So fashion and football hehe…
