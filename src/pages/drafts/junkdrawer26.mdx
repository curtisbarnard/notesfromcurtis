One of my recent assignments was to photograph a dress rehearsal for a play called Arcadia. The play is set in two time period’s (1800’s and 1980’s) and takes place in England.

Equipment Used:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8 VR

Getting the Shot:
The last time i went to see a play was on a field trip in elementary school, but this doesn’t mean i don’t like shooting plays. Going to dress rehearsals is actually one of my favorite subjects to shoot. What isn’t there to like? The scripts are usually funny, the costumes and sets are always different, people exaggerate their emotion, and i’m usually the only person in the auditorium apart from the directors. Usually i try to sit up higher in the auditorium and use a longer lens so i can get some depth between the actors. To get different angles i just move around as i have plenty of room with the lack of people.
