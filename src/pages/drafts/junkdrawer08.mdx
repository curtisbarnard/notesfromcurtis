Once again I found myself heading south on the I-5 corridor. It was Saturday and that meant game time in Corvallis. I tried to stay near the speed limit to conserve some gas, but others around me were obviously excited for the game. Droves of cars with beaver flags flailing in the air streaked past me, heading for Reser stadium. Rain had fallen earlier in the day and the air had a distinct Oregon freshness about it. As I neared Corvallis I thought of how nice it was to be back home.

With just my D90 and a Nikkor 70-200mm VR I came into the stadium, by now more than half full. I knew that I had missed being on campus, going to sports events and taking photos, and just generally being involved at OSU, but I wasn’t aware just how much I missed it. Tears of joy almost came from my eyes, but that sight wouldn’t have been a proper one for a sports photographer.

My joy continued into the 2nd half of the game, but by 3rd quarter the beavers were down and it looked like No. 17 Cincinnati was going to pull off a victory. The beavers still played as if they had a chance, but it was obvious this was going to be the first loss of the season. After the game I walked away sad, towards the photo office, but still excited for the season to come. This is OUR season…
