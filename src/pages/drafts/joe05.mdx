Day At The Park
may 8th 2009
So today I had my Saturday International Business class and because it was such a great day outside, I group of us decided to go hang out at the park for the afternoon. Everyone brought their cameras and guitars, and then we bought snacks and drinks on the way there. A few more people came as the day went on and everyone had a really fun time.

Both Jun and Sean brought their guitars

Everyone think tanking, jk

Everyone singing Steven's famous karaoke song--"Ring of Fire"
