When I'm lucky enough to be in Portland on a Saturday I make it a point to go by the farmer's market. Even this early in the season the market is packed with fresh produce both grown and foraged. The last couple of visits to the market Tram and I noticed fiddleheads. An interesting sprig of green that we wanted to try.

Fiddleheads are the very young shoots of ferns. Their season is very short as you want to pick them before they unfurl or get to high above the ground. Once too big they develop a toxin and become bitter. Here in the Northwest most of the fiddle heads come from the Lady Fern (Athyrium filix-femina) or the Bracken Fern (Pteridium aquilinum).

Last weekend we decided to pick up some fiddleheads and to go with them some shiitake mushrooms and little golden potatoes. Tram wasn't able to cook them up until last night, by which time a few had gone bad even while sitting in the refrigerator. While she was cooking up the dish, I was setting up my impromptu studio in the kitchen.

The dish ended up being steak with a shiitake roux on top and served with blanched fiddleheads and roasted potatoes. Everything turned out spectacular. The steaks was a perfect medium rare and combined with the mushroom roux it was pure heaven. The fiddleheads were very good, far better than I thought they would be.I would say the taste was something like asparagus with a slight bitterness at the end. The potatoes were cooked just enough be soft, yet still hold their shape and when combined with the roux were amazing. It was probably one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.

Now that I know how good fiddleheads are I'm going to have to pick them next year!
