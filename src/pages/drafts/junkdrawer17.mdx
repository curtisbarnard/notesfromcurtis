When the weather clears and fresh food abounds, Portland is great for outdoor dining. There are plenty of decent patio's in Portland where you can grab a nice happy hour snack and drink, but over the past couple days I went to two great food cart's. Food cart's have exploded over the last few years in Portland and it's hard to go wrong, but only a  select few offer the very best.

Built to Grill is a Italian focused food cart located at one of the major food cart strips on 3rd and Washington. I awoke late one morning feeling the effects of a party the night before and I was craving pasta. I'd heard of built to grill several months back, but every time I'd gone it was closed. Fortunately it was a weekday and I knew they'd be open around 11:30am. I arrived a few minutes early and watched as the owners (a couple, which I neglected to get their names) prepped the food for the coming lunch rush. Being the first in line I knew my food would be fresh and of the best quality, but as the sign says everything is made to order and this is not a fast food eatery so even if your 100th in line it will be fresh.

After contemplating the menu I settled on the Penne alla Vodka, which had penne pasta, italian sausage, and marinara sauce. The pasta also came with a slice of bread. While waiting for the meal I overheard the owners talking about recent business.  As yelp reviews and the line outside attested this place is well loved. Even with the constant business they take the time to do a food cart right. They even come in to clean the whole cart down on Sunday's. I watched them prepare the pasta and was surprised at how clean the cart was inside, which seems to be a rare occurrence in the world of street food.

When I received the box with Italian goodness inside I took out the camera to take a picture. Before I could snap a picture though the lady sprinkled some chopped parsley on top to set the dish off showing their dedication to running a fine establishment. The pre meal show did not overshadow the flavor of the pasta though. It's simply the best food cart meal I've had in Portland and can't be described, only eaten.

The next day was warmer, thus my appetite suffered and nothing sounded good. After going by the Mississippi Food Cart Court at Mississippi and Skidmore to get my girlfriend something to eat I found a curious looking place on yelp called Zenbu.

We walked the 10 blocks or so to a smaller food court of only three carts, but much more secluded than the previous court. On the menu for Zenbu my eyes were immediately drawn to Katsu as this was one of may favorite things to eat while in Japan. The plate came out looking fairly close to an authentic katsu dish in Japan, yet it had a northwest spin with the bright and fresh vegetable's. After taking a seat at a large wooden picnic table under a shade tree I dug it. Simply delicious. Under the pork katsu was a bed of cabbage and for sides was rice and a salad with some interesting carrot like pasta/dressing. The flavors all went well together and if I had to be nit picky I would say that there was too much sauce on the cabbage/katsu. No worries though as it's an easy fix, just say “can I have a little less teriyaki sauce.”

I'll surely be visiting both of these places again. Both have great, but different styles of food. Both are located in interesting area's of Portland. Both have food cartieers which are lovely to have a chat with on a summer day. Finally both are dirt cheap with entrees around $6-7. If your out and about for a walk around Portland try out a food cart because you just might get a better meal than most of the restaurants in the city.
