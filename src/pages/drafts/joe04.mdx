Golden Week Pt. 4 -- 鍋物 (Nabemono)
may 6th, 2009
Today we were originally going to go see Tokyo Tower, but because of the rain, we went to a Nabe restaurant in Ikebukuro.

The appetizer was vinegary and delicious and luckily did not have a hefty fee attached. In Japanese restaurants, you do not tip, but most restaurants often compensate for this by adding a seating fee or giving you small and expensive appetizers. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting a good deal at a restaurant until I realize they attached a $5 seating fee per person.

Nabemono (or nabe) is a type of Japanese cooking where, depending on the dish, cook various foods together in a pot at the table via a portable stove top. Nabe is typically eatten during the colder months, but we thought that because of the rain, it was ok. It is also thought that if you eat closer together out of the same pot, it will help build strong and closer relationships.

The type we ate was Yosenabe 寄鍋 which was a variety of meat, seafood, vegetables, tofu, and noodles. We got two different types of broth: Miso and Soy Sauce. Both were equally good! Other types of popular Nabe that I have heard of, but have not tried yet are: Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu, both of which use dips.

After everything is eaten, people often put rice in the remaining broth to finish it off. Everything was really good!

Afterward, we went to hang out in a nearby park before everyone went back home. There was no where to sit because of the rain, so people squatted.
