A couple days ago there was a black history dinner on campus. There was a slide show, a speaker, and some drum line entertainment from SEI. During the slide show each table had a discussion about different black figures in history.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8
Nikon SB-800

Getting the Shot:
Ideally i should have gotten a good photograph during the slide show discussion, but I didn’t come out with anything satisfying. Instead I tried to get a good photo of the drum line. I used an SB-800 bounced of the ceiling to provide a little more light and stop the action somewhat. You can see the bluish light on the right hand side of the photo from the flash. I think a gel or some sort of coloring over the flash head would have made the light look better. Alas i don’t have any gels.
