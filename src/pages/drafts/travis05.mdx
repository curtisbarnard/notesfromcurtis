Some of our dorm mates went to the Tokyo Giants game in Yokohama.

Yokohama baystars suck. the score was 12-1.

The teams each had a team of cheerleaders.

My dorm mate Roy decided it would be a great idea to bring his horn along. This ended up being a bad idea since the cheering in Japanese baseball is very systematic and organized. You only cheer/be loud when your team is up to bat. Therefore, Roy would randomly blow his loud horn and almost ALL the Japanese people around us would look and give us a funny stare. After an hour or so, a policeman came and politely told him to stop by giving him the crossed fingers for "dame". He told us that is messed up the beat of the chants.

The Japanese form of cheering is in short chants and songs that get very repetitive after a while. Have a look. This chant went on for more than 10 minutes.

During the time between these songs, everyone is almost completely silent. It was weird being in such a quiet stadium.
This was the cheer after someone scored.
