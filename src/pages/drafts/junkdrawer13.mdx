It's officially harvest season out at Abood Farms (My mom's fiance who owns the property and my partner in gardening crime!) as I just picked the first radishes which are also the first pieces of produce from the garden. This is the first time I've grown them and actually the first time I've had a garden in several years. Most of radishes are fairly full and clean, but some do have cracks from the few times I've forgotten to water them. The springtime is nice because the air isn't too hot yet and the rains still come to water the garden naturally, but the sun does show up every so often. When we get those five day stretches of pure blue sky it makes it hard to know when to water. The ground isn't yet bone dry, but the sun can beat down and so it's a must to keep on top of all the plants. Once the weather warms up it's much easier to get into a watering schedule that makes the plants happy.

Due to my lack of having a veggie garden in recent years I'm hoping to learn a lot this season. In addition to the radishes there are plenty of other vegetables. My goal is to learn what edibles grow well here, collect some seed from thriving plants to try and “naturalize” them, harvest enough to can, dry, freeze, and preserve summers bounty for the winter time. Here's a current list of what's growing now:
Beets
Snow peas
Tomato's
Strawberries
Raspberries
Blueberries
Corn
Bok choy
Collards
Onions
Broccolli
Potato's
Pumpkins

I've seeded lettuce, squash and cucumbers, but I think all the seed is sterile as none have sprouted. So while I don't list them they will probably be seeded with fresh seeds/starts soon. The plants that are doing great are the potato's, snow pea's, and strawberries. In fact just today some red has begun to appear on some delectable looking strawberries. From here on out the fresh produce will only increase!
