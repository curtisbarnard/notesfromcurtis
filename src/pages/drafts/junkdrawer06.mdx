My girlfriend and I went to Edgefield McMenamins last weekend, with empty stomach's. After we had filled ourselves on some classic pub far we headed out onto the grounds. It really is a beautiful place and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Portland. There were some trees blooming and because it's still fairly early in the season I assume they were Plum tree's. I may be wrong though, so please inform me if I am.

Also, a sign of spring, were all the bees! They were everywhere and I was trying to get some good photos with my 105mm micro, but it was difficult. I didn't have my tripod and I definately think it would have helped. I'm hoping I'll see some cool insects/bugs in Japan to get some macro photos of.
