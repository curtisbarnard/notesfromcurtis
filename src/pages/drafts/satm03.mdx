      of lava flows, until a series of earthquakes shakes the ground, then silence...BOOM! A giant explosion

      The main cluster of hot springs is located near the center of the caldera and southeast of the
      resurgent dome in an area named Whitmore Tubs. The area contains the following springs:

        This spring is the largest and most popular. The parking area is large but was filled with many
        people camping both in tents and trailers when I visited. From the parking lot is a short 1/4
        mile walk on a nice boardwalk through alkali meadows installed by the BLM in 1998<sup>
          <a href='http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/bishop/restoration/rp_wildwillies.html'>[7]</a>
        </sup>. First you'll pass by a small heart shaped tub which can hold around 8-10 people and is
        the hotter of the two. A few paces down the trail you'll come to the large tub which is partially
        gravel and partially concrete and can hold 20+ people. The larger tub has a nice temperature
        gradient, with it being very hot near the inlet and a nice comfortable temperature near the outlet.
        Unfortunately I forgot to bring my thermometer on this trip and so wasn't able to get readings,
        but I would guess that the upper pool is consistently over 100F and the lower pool anywhere from
        95F to 105F depending on where you are sitting.
        <br />
        <br />
        I visited the spring with Tram and a friend on a Friday evening around sunset in mid-summer
        and there were 20+ people between the two pools with everyone wearing a bathing
        suit.&nbsp;Many of us were drinking a beer and after a 15 minutes or so we'd struck up a
        conversation with strangers. I think soaking in hot water while watching the sun set in the
        Sierra's can even put the biggest grouch in a sociable mood. We picked up some critical
        intel on nearby springs during our conversations as well as recommendations for good hikes
        in the area.

        <h3 style='text-align: center;'>Hilltop Hot Spring</h3>
        <br />A third of a mile down Benton Crossing Rd. from the turnoff for Wild Willies is the turnoff
        for Hilltop Hot Spring, perhaps the most scenic of all the Whitmore tubs. The walk from the parking
        area is 1/4 mile on a nice gravel path and board walk that ends on a large white
        <a href='https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/earthscienceandengineering/rocklibrary/viewglossrecord.php?gID=00000000356'>
          silica sinter deposit
        </a>
        . After walking across the clearing, reminiscent of a moonscape, you come to a concrete and rock
        tub surrounded by turf mats. The mats may seem crude, but in reality are functional, saving your
        feet from the sharp pebbles while entering and exiting the tub. As you lower yourself in the
        tub, only large enough to fit 6-8 people, you see mountains to your east and west with the enormous
        Long Valley extending for what seems like an eternity to the north and south. The hill the spring
        sits atop is in reality only a small rise, but it is enough to give you a commanding view of
        your surroundings.

        I visited this spring in the morning around eight, too late for sunrise, but early enough to
        be the second car in the parking lot. Fresh cow patties dotted the grass and portions of the
        path on my walk to the tub. The chill of the morning air brought goose bumps to my skin. As
        I crested the hill I could see that no one was in the tub and for the moment it would be
        just the nearby cow's and I to share a pleasant Eastern Sierra morning. I dipped my hand
        into the water, checking the temperature, it was very hot. The previous bather had left the
        ball valve open almost the whole way, filling the tub with 105F+ degree spring water. There
        is no cool water nearby to temper the heat with so the only option is to turn off the valve
        and sit in the water for short duration while waiting for it to cool.

        The easiest to find of all the springs has to be The Rock Tub. Located just off Whitmore Tubs
        Rd. and much nearer to highway 395 you can drive right up to the tub. A smaller spring facing
        the eastern face of the sierras and only enough room for 4-8 people. In 2005 the BLM announced
        plans to restore the roads, dispersed camping sites and nearby Sage Grouse strutting grounds,
        called leks

        . While visiting I saw signs of roads blocked by boulders, but the main gravel roads were fairly
        rutted out and the campsites didn't seem to have any real maintenance done to them.

        compared with the Whitmore Tubs, but it's absolutely worth it.

        As you sink into the tub, formed of smooth concrete, you'll likely hear a dragonfly buzz past
        or maybe a grasshopper will flutter by. You may even see a <a href='http://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/yellow-headed-blackbird'>
          Yellow-headed Blackbird
        </a> in hot pursuit. The trickle of Little Hot Spring creek, just yards away, provides a relaxing
        audio bed to the song of summer in the High Sierras. After a few minutes, adjust the valve to
        let more spring water in, sit back and let the world melt away.

      . Hot Creek has been well known for generations as a place for great swimming and spectacular fishing.
      It was even a filming location for several movies in the 60's and 70's, among them

      While the gorge in particular has been popular for swimming in the past, it has had it's fair share
      of injuries and deaths, mostly due to users ignoring signs and fences and entering hot pools

      . With a heavy increase in unpredictable thermal activity in 2006, swimming has been prohibited
      indefinitely. Discharges of boiling water can erupt to heights of six feet in the middle of the
      previously calm stream, raising temperatures from 86F to 199F in seconds. These discharges often
      hit fish, causing them to cook instantly.

      is a wonderful place to visit. After a short hike down a paved trail you'll find yourself set
      in a rugged brown gorge, with lush green aquatic grasses running along the stream bed and
      brilliant cerulean colored pools lining the opposing bank. And if you've brought your fly rod
      along, after a short hike upstream or down, you may find yourself hooked into a beautiful
      trout.

      In 1990 scientist noticed that tree's were dying on the north side of Horseshoe Lake. At first
      the cause was though to be drought or insect infestations, but in 1994 the culprit was found
      to be abnormally high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the soil
      <sup>
        <a href='https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs172-96/' style='font-size: 13.3333px;'>

      Typical levels of soil CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>are around 1% or less; levels in the tree-kill area
      were found to be 20% to 90%! The tree-kill area rapidly grew to around 120 acres, but by 1996
      the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;discharge rate stabilized and the growth of the tree-kill area slowed

      .<br />
      <br />
      The reason for the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;discharge is thought to associated with a series of
      earthquakes in 1989 due to a magma chamber moving closer to the surface. These earthquakes
      likely caused fissures which allowed the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to escape from the chamber where
      it had been accumulating. There are several other tree-kill areas around Mammoth Mountain,
      which test have shown are caused by the same chemically identical CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;that is
      present at Horseshoe Lake. This points to the being a large chamber of gas in the mountain.

      To the west of Mammoth Mountain sits an excellent example of columnar basalt called Devils
      Postpile. While columnar basalt is not especially rare, the size and number of columns on
      display here put's it as one of the best sites in the world. Columnar basalt is formed due to
      stresses that occur when lava cools

      80,000 to 100,000 years ago a lave lake formed in this area, reaching depths of 400 feet in
      places, and as it cooled the joints in the basalt formed creating long symmetrical cracks. The
      formation remained hidden for thousands of years until finally, water and glaciers began to
      erode portions away

      The clusters of columns, estimated to be around 5,000 in total, have the appearance of a
      Moorish Temple. Research conducted by UC Berkeley has given rise to the theory that they were
      formed during the last explosion of the Long Valley Caldera. As cold snow melt seeped into the
      hot tuff deposit it boiled, creating convection columns. Research is still ongoing to better
      understand how these unique features were formed.
