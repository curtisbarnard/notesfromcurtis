Australian Gardening Videos
Thursday, July 24th, 2008

If your into organic vegetable/fruit gardening then i think i found a site you might be interested in. I recently watched a video from Gardening Australia about permaculture. It was a pretty good video and i definitely recommend it. This video isn’t the what i found though.

It’s the Gardening Australia website which has 4-8 minute videos on gardening. There are videos about ornamentals also, but i haven’t really watched them. The food plant videos are great though, aside from the silly Australian accent and slang. :D

I think all the videos only talk organic/permaculture too. They never mention crazy chemicals and always stress the importance of the soil and compost. This is something that we really lack here in America. If you watch almost any garden show they mention all sorts of chemicals and I’ve never even seen a decent example of permaculture.

The reason that Australia’s gardening scene is better than ours is their drought. Australia has been going through droughts for a while now and because of this they had to learn to be more efficient. Obviously they found that making the soil retain more water and such was a big help. I’m definitely impressed with what they do down there and i can’t wait until it catches on here in America.
