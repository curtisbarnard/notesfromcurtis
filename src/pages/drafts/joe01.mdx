--- April 2 ---

First Day of Orientation! I met my tutor Haruka again and turns out most of the tutors have at least 2 people they are tutoring and it just so happens that the other person is Roy, an exchange student from Mexico that lives in my dorm.--funny guy. We were supposed to have a campus tour, but it was Haruka's first semester on that campus, so our tour was less informative and more fun! I was interviewed about American fashion for the school paper because I'm that attractive! haha He asked me all these questions in Japanese and I barely understood any of it, but thankfully Haruka and Roy translated for me. Also, instead of eating in the cafeteria, we got food at the convenience store (コンビ二) because the cafeteria was packed.

After lunch was took our Japanese Placement Exam, which was kinda stressful since I did not really study and it made me realize how much I forgot since last semester. Sorry Suzuki-sensei! (ごめんなさい鈴木先生！)

They tutors had a surprise after out test, they were taking us to Yoyogi Park (代々木公園) for Hanami (花見), or "Cherry Blossom Viewing."

The Sakura's radiant beauty!

Sakura's are well know for their very short lifespans (~1-2 weeks) and exist as a metaphore for human's short time on the planet. To celebrate, friends and family sit under Sakura trees, bring snack, play games, and drink sake of course! In Japan, it is legal to drink outside, so no problem! Everyone chipped in 500 yen (~$5) for snacks and beer and then all the tutors and exchange students talked and had a great time! BTW this happened around 3pm :P

After Hanami, a few of us went out drinking in Shibuya. I didn't catch the name of the resaurant and I can't remember the names of everyone there. Names are normally hard for me to remember and when you throw in the fact that they are all unfamiliar, it is impossible (hyperbole rocks btw).
