Salem is a weird city. I've lived in Corvallis, a city of 50,000. I've lived in Portland, a city of 2 million. When compared with Portland and Corvallis Salem sits in the middle and lack pizazz. There's no abundance of hippies, not many places to eat, not many bike paths, and serious lack of community. The one distinction present is bureaucracy. Maybe Salem's title as Oregon's state capitol has resigned it to the depths of boringness.

I moved to Salem as a financial decision not out of desire and for the first six months of living here I treated as a place to sleep, but not play. But out of desperation to enjoy where I live I've recently set out out to find the soul of this city.

On a cloudy and mild day over the Memorial Day weekend I peddled off on my ten speed, heading for downtown Salem. Being memorial weekend there wasn't much traffic and so I easily glided through the one way streets of downtown, zig zagging my way around. On the southern side of downtown is Bush park, which features white oak groves, a football stadium and the only dedicated soap box derby track on the west coast.

This afternoon the track was hosting the 15th annual Best in the West race. I parked my bike on the lush green grass next to the track and took out my camera. Kids were coming down the tree lined track a pair at a time. It wasn't a joke to the racers either, no laughing and playing around. They ducked as low as possible while still being able to see, all to gain aerodynamic advantage.

Every 5 minutes a new pair of competitors would come down the track. As they rolled, not exactly flying, past me I noticed there were three car types. The craziest being a lay on your back sort and look through a tiny one inch crack at the hill ahead of you.

After talking to a few adults running the race and some kids about racing I gathered my stuff to leave. I started believing that if I looked in the right places Salem just might have some coolness to it. It would be a hard search, but surely a fruitful one.
