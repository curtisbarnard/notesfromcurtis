vLog #1 and Silent Invasion
Wednesday, April 23rd, 2008

Here’s the first vLog i have and i’ll have another in about a week.

Now i want to talk about The Silent Invasion a special produced by OPB. It was a good program and it really made me think about the worlds ecosystem. One part of me wants to stop all the invasive species, but the other part thinks that it’s part of the ecosystem. We as humans are part of the worlds ecosystem and how we affect the environment is part of the natural cycle.

Ultimately i feel that Oregon and the places i love should stay natural and we shouldn’t deliberately introduce outside species. And we should try to eliminate invasive species, but the measures we take should be put under a microscope. I don’t think using harmful chemicals in the removal of invasive plants is the answer, rather human labor is the only way to go.

Anyway that’s all for now I’ll see you in the next post.
