Today i walked to school like I've been doing so lately. I took the camera along hoping to catch something. There were lots of flowers out because it's spring obviously.
God's Day
But i saw some street art which i think is a little more interesting for today. Too many flowers lately. Anywy i really enjoy street art even though it's against the law and damages peoples property. I dunno what do you think? Do you like street art? I think it's more impressive for me because of the risk that is being taken and the speed that is required. That's it for now.
