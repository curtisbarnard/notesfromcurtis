Saturday morning we slowly got out of bed around 9am. A late start for most hikers. My girlfriend, Tram, and I were in no rush to get to the trail. I planned to be at the waterfall later in the day so that I would be able to take a longer exposure of the water, giving it the cliche dreamlike effect.

On the way up 205 we stopped at the Clackamas REI store so Tram could grab some new hiking socks. I wandered for a bit looking at all the cool gadgets I don't need, but desperately desire. It's a love hate relationship I have with REI, why is it so easy to want everything in the store? After REI we made a couple more stops, one being a Vietnamese deli/sandwich shop “Best Baguette.” The sandwiches are around $3 and pretty tasty and large for the price.

After a few minutes on 205 we exited onto Washington Highway 14 and headed east. I ate my sandwich while driving and staring out the window at the beautiful views. I was particularly impressed near cape horn and pulled off to take some pictures. Once near Carson I turned onto Wind River Hwy. and headed north then about 16 miles and a couple forest roads later we arrived at the Falls Creek Falls trail head.

There was a slight mist falling in the 2nd growth forest around us, not the snow we had expected. We geared up and set out on the lower trail, which is about 1.5 miles to the waterfall. Along the way we saw patches of snow, a miniature canyon which the creek roared through, sweeping bends in the creek, and plenty of mushrooms. Every 10 feet Tram would point out another mushroom and we would inspect them. Once we arrived at the falls there was still a little too much light out so we decided to hunt for more mushrooms to take pictures of. Walking back along the trail about a half mile we constantly stopped and snapped photos of the variety of mushrooms in this forest. It's only recently that I've become interested in mushrooms and I never expected to see so many on one hike. While browsing the miniature landscapes Tram pointed out a cool water droplet. I took a photo, the one above, and it turned out to be my favorite of the day.

The light had dimmed a little so we walked back to the waterfall and took some photos. I worked quickly as the spray from the falls made it “rain” more in that area. I was struggling to keep my camera dry, so I got the photo I wanted and packed up. We arrived back at the car just as night fell, took off our gear, turned on the heater and headed for home. Six miles later Tram realized she had left one of her shoes at the trail head so we drove back to get it. Finally sure that we had everything we headed home. It had been a long day and I was ready for a nice bed and some hearty food.
