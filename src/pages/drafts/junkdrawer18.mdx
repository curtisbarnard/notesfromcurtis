One morning before work while surfing the web I came across a site called Neighborhood Harvest of Salem. The purpose of the organization is to glean potentially wasted food and donate it to low income families. Specifically a group of volunteer pickers will show up at an orchard, field, or a single tree and pick all the fruit that's ripe. The pickers can keep up to half of what they pick and the other half goes to Marion-Polk Food Share or any other of a number of organizations who work with low income families. Of course before picking the owners of the fruit are asked if they would allow picking.

Groups of people and official organizations which glean food have become popular over the past five years throughout the country. As always there are two sides to the coin and some people are upset with the gleaning movement. Some neighbors of orchard owners get upset when 200+ people descend on the farm to pick. This should be of little concern as picking usually only last a couple hours and maybe only happen once a season or a couple times. Besides it's a bunch of peaceful people hanging out and picking food, not noisy drunken partying. It also seems that some farmers (ones who don't donate their crops) are upset that the pickers are getting all the fruit for only their labor and not paying cash. They may be worried that it will cut into their profit and reduce their customer base. I definitely feel for the farmers as they are already grossly underpaid, but I doubt that the small amount of people who participate both as pickers and host will diminish their income much.

Later in the evening, after work, I drove out to a blueberry farm to participate in my first harvest party. The sun was low in the cloudless sky, yet it wasn't too hot. It was one of those perfect Oregon summer days. I checked in, weighed my bucket, and set off into the blueberry patch. Whole families were out in full force. The adults covered the higher up berries and the young ones ran around grabbing the berries close to the ground. It was a true party. I talked with several people while cooking. Some of them planned to eat the berries plain, some in yogurt, some in blueberry pies. People didn't just talk of berries though as topics ranged from where you worked, what trips you were taking this summer, and when the next harvest party may be.

While checking in I'd talked with the party coordinator, Lisa, about the organization and this particular patch of blueberries. Apparently the owner of this blueberry batch was a classic case of being pushed out by the big agricorps. The local processor which had harvested, processed, and sold the blueberries decided to only take blueberries from large farms to preserve their profits. Thus this grower with only a couple acres of berries had nowhere to sell the berries. Rather than let all the berries go to the birds and soil the grower donated the crop to Neighborhood Harvest.

Pickers may leave at anytime before the party ends (the typical party last about 2.5 hours), so I decided to call it quits after an hour and a half. My five gallon bucket was about a third full so I was guessing I'd picked maybe seven pounds. At weight out my total harvest came to 11.5 lbs! I poured out my donated portion and kept four pounds for myself. I'm hoping to use it to brew a refreshing blueberry beer, if they last long enough in the freezer.
