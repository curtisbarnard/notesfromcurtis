#3: I often search the CNN site for videos about japan and just happened to come across this short clip about homeless people in Japan/Tokyo. In a country with a very small unemployed population things are beginning to change. How will Japan cope with this change?

#2: Tokyocooney always puts out a decent show. Yes i would call it a show nowadays as the post are usually long and have a focus on some specific aspect of life in japan. Check out Kevin Cooney in his New Year's 2009 video:

#1: The best video I've seen in the past week is this collection of nature time lapse videos set to Mockmoon2000's original piano work. I recommend you watch this in HD as the music and photo's are spectacular!
