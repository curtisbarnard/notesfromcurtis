After a couple of away meets the girls returned Friday night for a home meet against #4 UCLA. They gave it all they had, but still came up short in a close loss to UCLA.

Equipment:
Nikon D90
Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8

Getting the Shot:
I decided to go down low again for the beam. Overall i’m pleased with the shots i got, but i think i should have been on the other end of the beam as the gymnasts were facing away during key portions of their routine. The 70-200 is in for service right now and I think the 80-200 is lacking in focus speed/accuracy and overall sharpness. I can’t wait until the VR is back…
