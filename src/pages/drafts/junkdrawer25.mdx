Winston Wilkinson, Director of Civil Rights for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, spoke last week about social justice. While there was nothing new said on the topic, i did enjoy his stories of being a Black American during the civil rights movement.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8 VR

Getting the Shot:
Yet another lecture, but this one was far more enjoyable to shoot. The background was a dark red velvet curtain which absorbed light, allowing me to up the shutter speed and basically turn the background to black. I also liked the lighting, it gave the photo a more dramatic effect. I came into the auditorium and posted up in the front row. From then on i simply waited for an interesting hand gesture, and there were plenty, and clicked the shutter.
