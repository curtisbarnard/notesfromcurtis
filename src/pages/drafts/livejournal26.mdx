Grueling hike
location: Corvallis, OR
Philomath
Yesterday i conquered the longest hike/walk I've ever been on. I walked about 4.5 miles to bald hill from my apartment and then hiked 1-1.5 miles up to the top of bald hill. The hike there wasn't bad. I did have my day pack with me, but i was only carrying a sweater, coat, hat, gloves, a couple sandwiches, a tripod, a couple bottles of water, and my camera. Not very heavy. I was also listening to some podcasts on the way to the park, i'm pretty far behind on them all so i'm trying to catch up. Once i got to the bottom of the hill i wasn't even exhausted. I climbed up and sat on a bench at the top, yet to be very tired. Snapped some pictures and just relaxed for 45 minutes or so. It was awesome up top, the view would be even better at night so i plan to do that trip soon. After i was done up top i began my trip down. The slope and doing the little downhill shuffle type walk (you know what i'm talking about if your a hiker) killed my feet. I wasn't physically tired yet, but my feet began to burn and i still had 4+ miles left on the pavement! I was about 3/4 of the way back when the exhaustion set in. I was in the "put your feet in front of each other and keep moving" mode. It was terrible, I've never experienced anything like it before. Once i got home i took a shower and just laid around. That damn hike was one of the craziest, but most satisfying thing i've ever done. I'll go on a long hike again, but i'm not sure how soon.

Oh yeah the photo was taken at the top facing south west toward Philomath (fill-low-muth). If you head to my flickr you can see another photo which is my first attempt at HDR.

Peace-Curtis
