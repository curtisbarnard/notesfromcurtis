While the weather outside was cold, rainy and far from good hiking weather I surfed my favorite hiking website portlandhikers.org. All the great people over there post up trip reports for the most recent hikes they've gone on. This day one hike caught my eye, or rather it sounded like a scramble. There was no defined and maintained trail, no designated parking lot, only some notes about how many yards to go this way and to look for a bench on the side of the hill. When one of the first beautiful days of 2010 arrived I concluded it would be the perfect day for an adventure.

I quickly searched the internet for all intel available on the area. USGS maps, directions on where to go and photos of landmarks. Tram and I set off up the Clackamas River towards Memaloose Rd. The sun was out and shining bright, yet there was still a chill in the air. As we pulled off the side off the road I was excited to see how well we could navigate with no trail.

Directly from the road we followed an old road which has been dug in by tractors to keep vehicles out. The further down the road we went the more the brush and trees engulfed us, until we came to a clearing. This was where the road stopped and was checkpoint number one. So far so good so we continued on. Next we needed to start climbing down the side of the hill and no more then 10 steps down we saw the garter snake. He was chillin' out in the sun trying to warm up. He must have been pretty cold as he posed for several minutes while I took tons of photos, not once did he strike or seem alarmed.

Photo shoot completed we moved on down the hill. After another 30 steps there was a large open rock field which was very steep. The rocks were loose and we slowly slid our way down. The next direction was to get around 70 feet above the creek at the bottom of the ravine and then follow it downstream. We did so, albeit very slowly as the hill was unstable. Then we hit a wall of brambles. I looked uphill and there didn't seem to be a break in the plants. “Ok what about downhill?” I asked myself. Nope it only go steeper and appeared to be slippery due top  spring on the side of the hill. We decided to go uphill and search for a way around as it seemed the safer of the two options.

Twenty minutes later we were in the midst of the underbrush following what seemed to be a trail, but really wasn't. Frustrated we stopped and talked over our next plan of action. Being early in the season we were out of shape leading to the decision to retreat back to the car. Plus we didn't want to become the lost hikers on the news that you so often hear about this time of the year. I felt defeated, but comforted myself with the fact that I could try again later this year.

I'm purposely not giving specifics about how to get to the area and what lies at the end of the hike to make it more challenging. If your resourceful with the internet it's not to hard to find out about this off trail trek. Hopefully I'll report back later this year with a successful outcome.
