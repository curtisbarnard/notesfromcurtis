As I opened my eyes there was a bright flash of yellow and then darkness. It's been a while since I've seen the sun, but this morning I was reminded of what summer felt like. After motivating myself out of bed, a hard thing to do the day after partying with a Japanese friend, I gathered all my crap. My girlfriend was out of bed soon and we were saying goodbye to my friends. We'd just spent the weekend in Seattle checking out the bars and catching up with some of my friends from Japan. The weekend was coming to a close and we got in the car to head home.

It had been an unusual sunny weekend and it looked as though it would continue as we crossed of the the Tacoma narrows bridge. We pointed the car west shooting for highway 101, where we would head south down to Astoria. There's a little place in Astoria called Bowpicker Fish & Chips which is supposed to have some great deep fried tuna. On two previous trips to Astoria the weather had been bad or the owners had been on vacation. You see Bowpicker isn't a sit down restaurant, it's actually an old boat sitting in an empty lot in town. Being a food stand it's subject to the weather conditions. Today with the nice weather I was sure that I would finally get to try it out.

Then as we neared the Washington coast, clouds drifted in, and raindrops began falling. Another ten minutes passed and the rain had turn to a torrential downpour. As I floated my car from turn to turn going south on 101, my hopes of fish and chips faded. The bridge over to Astoria came into view and miraculously the clouds seemed to thin and sun was shining on Astoria. Rain on one side of the Columbia and sun on the other. True northwest weather. With spirits high I made my way through Astoria to Bowpicker.

They were closed. The weather was nice, but a nicer note had been left at the ordering window:

“We will not be here March 4-6″

Noooooooo! Determined not to let the trip to the coast I continued my drive south on 101. Maybe Seaside would have a decent fish and chips place. Fifteen minutes later, no there was no good restaurants in Seaside. Arcade's, shirt shops with unfunny phrases written on the shirts, piles of salt water taffy, and fast food restaurants. I've never liked Seaside. Next stop Cannon Beach.

The torrential downpour had begun again. Driving, no more like floating into Cannon Beach we saw but a few other people. It was absolutely dead. We spotted a little fish shop called Ecola Seafood Restaurant & Market and practically swam through the river of rain in the streets to get inside. Walking in it's apparent that this is no fancy establishment. Tables and chairs about the room, a case displaying fresh seafood, and a somewhat old school menu on the wall behind the counter. I was still craving fish and chips so we got the  cod and at around $13 I was hoping it would be damned good.

We chowed down on the basket testing the vinegar, lemon and tartar sauce. All three tasted great, but I'm a tartar sauce type of guy and we promptly removed any trace of food from our table. The fish was as good as any I've ever had, the “chips” were a little bland and could have been better. The price probably wasn't worth it, but I know that at lunch time there prices are lower and when your craving fish and chips nothing else will do. We left Cannon Beach satisfied, bellies full and tired, but still wondering when we would experience the Bowpicker.
