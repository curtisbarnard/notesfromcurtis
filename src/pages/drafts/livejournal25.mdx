For today's walk i went down to a local school. It was a short walk compared to yesterday's 9 miles and blisters. Tomorrow i'm planning a 10-11 mile walk so i deserved a bit of rest. Anyway i went to the school with the intention of getting a cool moving clouds at night shot. I did get one indeed. I like the shot, it's not awesome, but i'm satisfied. Well until tomorrow that's all.

Peace-Curtis
