Golden Week Pt. 3 -- BBQ
may 4th, 2009
Today a bunch of us from the dorm went to a BBQ sponsored by one of the university's clubs, the English Speaking Society (ESS), at Futako Tamagawa. Futako Tamagawa is a river in between my dorm and the university and is on the same line we use everyday, so we see it everyday on our way to school.

Beatiful isn't it?

After some confusion with the organizers, we finally found out that we were supposed to be on the other side of the river which looks like this:

It was no matter though, because it is safer and we still had a really good time!

Nya~!

It was a bunch of people's birthday in the ESS, so the president gave everyone birthday presents of random snacks, haha!
