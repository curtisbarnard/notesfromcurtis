In early spring I foraged some nettles here in Salem. I collected enough to dry for tea and had plenty of surplus so I threw it in the freezer. My intention had been to make a nettle pesto that I found online at Landon Cook's blog. Well after almost three months I finally got around to making it.

I didn't quite have enough nettles to follow the recipe so I scaled it down a bit and kinda made it on the fly. When I tasted the pesto fresh from the blender (try to use a food processor as a blender doesn't do the job well) it was incredibly garlicky. Once I cooked up a portion of pasta and mixed a gallop of pesto the garlic was actually almost perfect. The flavor of the nettle's comes through very subtly as an earthy almost tea like taste. All in all it was great and cheap, plus with the dollops frozen it allows me to make a quick and fulfilling pasta meal.
