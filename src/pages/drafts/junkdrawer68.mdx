I thought i would try to share a photo from each one of my barometer assignments this term. Here it is my first assignment of the term, Vagina Monologues Auditions. Although I’ve never seen the “play” taking photos of the audition did make it sound quite interesting. I think the format of this post will be to give a little intro into the subject of the photo and then just explain what i did to get the photo.

Getting the shot: Equipment used was a Nikon D300 and the Nikkor 17-55 f/2.8 DX Lens. I also brought along an SB-800 and a Nikkor 70-200 f/2.8 VR because i thought the auditions would be in some sort of auditorium. Obviously i didn’t need to use either of those items though as i was in a fairly cramped room and had sufficient lighting. Using the D300 allowed me to put the ISO up to 800 without any worry, this is why i didn’t need any flash. I also set WB to flouro because that’s what the lighting was. Finally i put the camera in Aperture priority mode (a feature i never used to use, but now i’m starting to see the value in it.) and shot away. I felt only one angle would work for the photo, the women in the foreground delivering her lines with emotion and the chalkboard in the background with the writing on it. The photo has the ability to tell a story without an accompanying article, which is nice and something that i enjoy being able to do. Some assignments are rather difficult to get one of these types of photos though. Anyway this shot was really all that was available, although i did play with other angles, there was simply too much clutter around.
