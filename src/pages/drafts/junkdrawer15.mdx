Last week the girlfriend and I scoured maps, books, and websites looking for a place to backpack to for a night. After a while our eyes fell upon the Mt. Jefferson area. Santiam pass is only 90 minutes from Salem and so is fairly convenient, plus it's an area I've never really camped. While looking at the USGS quadrangles for the area I came across a place called Eight Lakes Basin that looked interesting, but quickly determined it was both too far and too high in elevation. Just south of the Eight Lakes Basin was Duffy lake which sat at 4800'. Earlier I'd checked the internet for the probable snow level throughout Oregon and it was around 5000'. Happy that we wouldn't be likely to encounter too much snow we agreed to set off the next morning for Santiam pass.
The next day at the trail head I scanned the map and realized we'd have to go over a hump at about 5400', well above the snow level. The day was sunny and I hoped the recent nice weather had melted some of the snow. With the possibility of not reaching the lake in the back of my mind we set out. The first leg of the hike goes through a severely burned area south of Three Fingered Jack which was a part of the B & B fires back in 2003. It reminded me of some of the bad burn's in Yellowstone with all the black snags and small tuft's of green popping up. Hiking north towards Three Fingered Jack, we turned around and stood in aw of Mt. Washington. The view was spectacular.

After passing a few lakes the burn begins to thin out and more green trees appear. At this point the snow also started to appear. Elusive at first sitting off trail in the trees. Then eventually patches covering parts of the trail. I'd hoped to see some mushrooms on the hike and finally some snowbank morels popped up next to an icy patch of snow. I'm pretty sure of my identification, and they are edible, but being new to mushrooming I left them where they stood and continued on.

Before we started to hit deeper snow we encountered more views, crossed a frigid creek, and got attacked by mosquitoes next to a lake. So when the trail disappeared under a 4 foot snowbank with only white beyond we were relieved. Finally we could lower our arms and not constantly slap ourselves and each other, trying to out battle the skeeters. A couple miles and a lot of springtime corn snow later we were tired and wet so we decided to turn back and stay at a nice camp we'd seen along the way. The campsite was surrounded by snowbanks, with a beautiful creek running by and a rocky bluff overlooking us. We arrived early enough to set up the tent and take an afternoon nap before cooking dinner and then eventually falling asleep under semi-clear skies.

The next day after lazing about our temporary home in the morning we quickly hiked out stopping at a few of the best points along the way to take pictures, grab a snack, and swig some water. Both day's the weather had been spectacular and almost scorching in the barren burned area. The sun had drained me of water and the reflection from the sun on the snow had fried my face. As we drove off towards home all I could think of was an ice cold milkshake.
