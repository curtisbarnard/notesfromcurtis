About a week back i went to a lecture to take some photos. It was a lecture series put on by OSU for horse owners. This night the topic was the navicular bone and diseases in general that affect the lower leg/ankle.

Equipment:
Nikon D2h
Nikkor 70-200 f/2.8 VR

Getting the shot:
Lectures and presentations are one of the most common assignments for a newspaper photographer, unfortunately they are also one of the least fun. Sure you can learn some good information from the lecture, but as far as creative photography goes your a little limited. This night was worse than usualy as i really only had one viable angle with a clean background. Just of photo right was an open electrical box that would have been very distracting and the lecturer faced left the entire time. All there was to do was wait for an interesting PowerPoint slide and a good expression from the lectureâ€”SNAP!
