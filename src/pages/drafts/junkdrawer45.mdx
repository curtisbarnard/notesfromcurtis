Recently i’ve been getting the itch to make my community green. I’m not talking about the “green” trend, but actually plant some plants and make the community GREEN! The video above shows a great way for some larger cities to bring some naturalness to the citiscape.

Living in Portland most of my life i’ve used the MAX a lot. Whether it was going to school or going on skateboard missions i always enjoyed the ride in an eletric train. One thing i always wondered was why they used so much gravel or concrete below the tracks. It’s so stale and ugly. A great solution is shown in the above video, plant some grass.

Really it’s not even neccesary to plant grass. I think some native groundcovers would be great to use. That would mean less water, but you still the benefits of apperance and less heat. This use of plants to lower the heat is bringing something to issue that isn’t thought of much by the common person.

I always felt the heat from the asphalt or conrete as i walked or skated around on hot summer days, but i never made the connection of the air heat and the exspanse of roads and paved things. Once you go from a paved area to a non paved one, even a field you can immediatly feel the difference. The air just feels cleaner and cooler, not to mention your feet feel great.

I think i’ll try and put some natives around my city where there is bare dirt so i can help reduce the temperature in my city by 0.0000000000001 of a degree!
