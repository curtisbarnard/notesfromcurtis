Morioka Morning Market (盛岡朝市)

The morning was chilly, in the low 40's, but the skies were clear. The sun was peaking just above the horizon. Once I had a coat on and my camera around my shoulder I left the hotel heading for Mikoda Morning Market (神子田朝市). From the hotel, located in Chuodori, to the market, located in Mikoda-cho, was 1.7 miles. Rather than take a taxi I decided to walk and observe the morning rituals that a city has when it wakes.
