Golden Week Pt. 2 - Ryohei's Party
may 3rd 2009
3After everyone left Akihabara, we went to Mejiro for our friend Ryouhei's party. A lot of our exchange student and Japanese friends were going, so we all bought a little something to help contribute; most people just bought something along the lines of a bag a chips.
Our Akihabara group waiting at the Mejiro station for everyone to arrive.

After everyone showed up, we headed toward Ryouhei's

Ryouhei was quoted before when he was preparing: "Will 200 be enough or should I get 300..." I'm glad he stuck with the former. :P

Most of the time, we were hanging out on his roof deck where we got an expansive view of the city.

My camera doesn't do it justice

Everyone is looking their best!

Sometime near the end of the party (around 8:30 - 9pm), the police show up because of a "noise complaint." One of the ojiichan got irritated at how loud we were on the roof, which is understandable. The only thing that got me was: the number of police officers responding (maybe around 10+) and the hour of the noise violation. Apparently the reason for the number of officers was they were making sure there were no high school students. The cops ended up being really cool and talked to a few of us about where we were from.

Everyone's favorite quote of the night comes from Little Steven who, despite being a little tipsy when the cops arrived, said "F--- the police! I'LL take care of them!" Haha, he gets so defiant when he drinks!

Such a fun night!
