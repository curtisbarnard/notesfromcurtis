Baby Ducks!
Aren't they just too cute? This is a photo from my walk two days ago. It wasn't just a walk for walks sake like i planned to do, but my girlfriend and i walked to the theater to see the new Indiana Jones movie. The movie was good, but not awesome. Definitely doesn't stick with the typical Indiana Jones style of plot. Anyway after the movie we began to walk home, but decided to walk over to a little pond/storm water runoff area where the ducks hang out. Well the babies were out and were a great photo subject. They remind me of my chickens that i got a year ago. Baby birds are just so cute. That's the photo of the day, i hope you enjoyed it.

Peace-Curtis
