Here is a link to an interesting article from the Timesonline. The article talks about some companies in japan that your can hire to suduce your spouse, or reuinite you with a lost love. They provide an easy, albeit pricey way of divorcing your spouse.

The first thing i think is how funny japan is. You CAN find anything in the land of the rising sun. It seems that this service stems from the japanese style of indirectness. Although it has it purpose, a spouse which refuses to divorce with you although the marriage is clearly not working. It’s also an indirect way of sperating from someone, no drama for you.
