Peak Moment: Suburban Foodshed
Monday, September 1st, 2008

I’ve been subscribe to peak moment on youtube for a while now and this is a recent episode they have posted. This is something i really think is good for our environment. I don’t mean just the planet, but for our daily lives. How much happier would you be having nature really surround you everyday. If you can get rid of the typical household view from the 50’s and see how much more rich and beautiful our lives  can be then you would be happier.

Then they discuss some community aspects of growing food in everyones yard. This is something i really wish exsisted. The lack of a community these days is fairly sad. You have to drive across town to meet up with your friends.

Anyway enough of my babbling just watch the video and it will explain itself.
