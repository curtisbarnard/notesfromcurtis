Dormy Aobadai Crew--we have superpowers, legit

Last night was the 80's party held for the exchange student crowd at a bar close to campus. Everyone decked themselves out is everything 80's and joined for a night of ridiculous fun! I couldn't get my camera to the right setting, so I'm using some photos from Curtis's album. His camera is serious, plus check out his blog: http://junkdrawer.web44.net/blog/?p=719

Take 2, Shogo was trying to be cool by not looking at the camera! :D

Brad as M.J.--may his memory live on!

After the event at the bar, most people went to Yoyogi park to hang out until the trains started running again in the morning. Some people sang and talked in other languages, others tried their best to stargaze or took a nap, but it is safe to say that everyone enjoyed themselves.
