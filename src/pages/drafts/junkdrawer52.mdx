I really don’t like reality TV. It was funny at first, but now it’s just the same old over dramatic wannabe actors trying to get their 15 minutes. Why would i want to watch any of that crap when i can watch something on OPB? The other day I went to a lecture about the negative portrayal of women in reality TV. Jennifer Pozner was the speaker and she had a beef with the industry and wanted to change the way people looked at reality TV.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8

Getting the Shot:
Another day, another lecture. I tried to get a better background on this photo than usual and i think it works nicely. I didn’t even notice that the girls eyes on screen were looking at the speaker until opening the photo on my computer. It helps draw the eyes to the speaker and away from the screen a bit so i enjoy that aspect of the photo. Lighting was pretty bad and i didn’t want to use a flash so i had the ISO up around 2000 and the shutter speed around 1/80 or 1/100.
