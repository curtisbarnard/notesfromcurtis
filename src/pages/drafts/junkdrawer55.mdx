_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

kind of feel bad giving this book 3 stars, but I think there could definitely be improvement. The variety
of photographs seems huge at first, but after flipping through the book a couple times it’s a bit repetitive.

I did enjoy the introduction as it gives a unique view of Japan and the love hotel industry. Obviously there are many different opinions on why Japan's culture is the way it is and I enjoy them all whether they are right or wrong. This book has a 4-5 page insight into sex in Japan.

Another section I really liked about the book where the customer questionnaires. Some where amusing, others where perplexing, but all were enjoyable. I think this section could definitely be expanded.

The two things that I feel would make this book a 5 star book are more writing and more photographic variety. As far as writing I would like expanded captions for photographs to help explain the rooms a bit more in detail. For photographic variety I would love more close up shots of small details and maybe more artistic shots. The pictures in this book tend to be more “real estate” than artsy. Even though I gave the book three stars and even though I think it could be improved I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Japans sex culture, or just the odder aspects of Japan.
