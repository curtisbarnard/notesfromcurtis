Yesterday I walked to school instead of my usual biking or driving. It took around 28 minutes which isn't bad at all and it allows me to listen to the
Pincones
podcast that i follow. Right now i'm following TokyoCalling which isn't updated too often, but i'm listening to the back episodes. I'm on 82 of 119, so i'm getting close to catching up. It's not the type of podcast that i expected, but i really enjoy Scott's voice and he usually talks about interesting things. So go give it a listen and see what you think. After classes my girlfriend came over to campus on her bike and we were going to walk around. I'd been wanting to head to Fairbanks hall and check out the art gallery so we headed that way. Unfortunately the exhibit i wanted to see had just been taken down and they were preparing for the next exhibit. As i sulked away i noticed these pine cones which I've never seen before. I liked them a lot and decided to snap a picture. So while one door was closed another was open. Do you like the pine cones?
