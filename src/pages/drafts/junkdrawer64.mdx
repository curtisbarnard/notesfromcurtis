Some photos from July
Friday, August 29th, 2008

These are some fireworks from the July 4th firework show in Salem, OR. This is my first attempt at fireworks and i liked them, hopefully next time i’m around some fireworks i can get some more interesting foreground subjects.

これはオレゴンのセーレムの七月四日の花火。私の初回は花火の写真を撮って、好きです。

This is a view from the top of bald hill. It’s in the same spot as one of my earlier photos except i decide to add my bike and a hiker enjoying the view. I really like this viewpoint now as it’s easy to get to. I mean i just cruised over after school and climbed to the top in no time, maybe 30 minutes or so.

Sick grab with my snowskate on the trampoline.

This is a covered bridge near the OSU dairy center. HDR with 3 photos.

これは屋根橋梁はOSUの側にあります。　HDRから三枚しゃしんです。
