_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while studying abroad in Japan. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />
was far too exhausted yesterday to write this post up, so I decided to leave it for today. Yesterday
was Monday, Monday’s are my busiest day at school. Class is from 1-6pm and that last hour and a half
are brutal. Luckily I was able to keep my motivation and carry out my plans to walk from school to Shinjuku
(新宿). I figured by the time I got to Shinjuku it would be dark and I could check out the cool night
views from a couple skyscrapers. I didn’t check any distances before heading out (6km/3.5miles from school
to Shinjuku), but I knew about how far it would be because I can see the skyscrapers from Yoyogi!

An hour and a half later, 7:30pm, I arrived at Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, boarded the elevator, and headed for the 45th floor. The view was AMAZING. The day had been clear so you could see forever it seemed. A big electric blanket seemed to stretch across the landscape, going until the end of time. I feel bad that I can describe it in more words or better pictures, but its simply one of those things you have to see for yourself. Time passed quickly and before I knew it I had to head down and go to the next building.

Next I went up into Shinjuku Center Building for a limited, but all new perspective on the Tokyo cityscape. From Center Building you can see all of Yoyogi park, or the dark patch that is Yoyogi. With all the lights you usually see in Tokyo it would seem finding a dark spot is nearly impossible, but there Yoyogi is, as dark as night. After marveling at the view I snapped some pictures and headed for ground level.

Now I had a decision to make; ride the Yamanote line back to Shibuya or walk back to Shibuya. Of course I chose the more difficult one and set off at a brisk pace towards Shibuya. I now know it was another 3 miles, but It honestly went by so fast that it didn’t seem nearly that far. There were so many things to look at along the way. The zombie salary men leaving the giant skyscrapers in droves. Cigarette in hand and nothing but food or women on their mind. Luckily one of Tokyo’s most famous red light districts is near by, Kabuki-cho, so I’m sure they got their fix.

About a mile away from Shinjuku I saw a strange sight. There was a group of ten or so men in formal suits, but not doing any job closely related to their attire. They were on the sidewalk busting up tiles and making different mosaics and such. Business man arts and crafts, at 9pm, on the sidewalk? Only in Tokyo.

Finally on the home stretch, just past Yoyogi, I saw a group of skateboarders. I used to skate a lot a couple years ago and every so often I miss it dearly. Since being in Tokyo I’ve gotten into the habit of approaching skateboarders and having a chat with them and trying a couple tricks. I considered passing this group, but I shouldn’t pass up the chance to make more friends so I headed over and had a nice chat. Skateboarders are always super nice to me and these guys were no different. I gave one of the guys my card and told him I wanted to hang out in the future so hopefully I hear back from him.

I power walked my way through Shibuya and went straight to the station. I had yet to feel tired, but I knew as soon as I stopped walking it would hit me. Once I was on the train I started to feel it and then I sat down. I did the head bob where you fall asleep and then your head falls so it wakes you up routine all the way to my station. I gathered my last bit of energy and walked the short walk back to my dorm. The bed hasn’t felt so good in a long time.
