_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='A' />

hh the days of riding Tri-met to downtown Portland and filming for our videos. Getting so hyped up because Jeff kick flipped a 6 stair. Those were the good old days. Now that we all have cars (and now that I'm away at college) we never do these things anymore. Even when we do hang out it's not nearly as fun because we don't have an adventure. It's like comparing a road trip (riding public transportation throughout the city) and flying a jet across the country (driving a car to skate spots). I've experienced all four and I have to say that it's always what happens on the journey thats memorable not what happens at the destination.

Today our lives are filled with too much fast paced crap. We all need to settle down sometimes and go on an adventure, experience the side of the world that you don't see when your speeding down the road at 80mph or flying across the country. It's always the little things that count. By the way [here is part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s-HEsOl9S4) in a 5 part series on our excursions to get the right shot. I finished and released the movie 2 years ago and haven't made a movie sense, I think I need to heed my own advice.
