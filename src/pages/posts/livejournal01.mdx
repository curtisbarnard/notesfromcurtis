_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='T' />

ruthfully because i want a blogging scholarship. Does this mean that I do not have things to say or I do not feel passionate? NO! Expect blogs about random things that I have opinions on and please do argue with me. I love debates!

I'm Curtis Barnard and I attend OSU, no the other OSU (Oregon State University). If you wish to know any other information about me then view my profile. That's it for now.

Peace
