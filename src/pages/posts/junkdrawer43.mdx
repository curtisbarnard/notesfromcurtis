_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />

enjoyed the combination of writing and photos, but neither could hold up on their own. The writing left much to be desired. It was jumpy and went off on a few tangents. Some of the photos were decent while others were blurry. I paid $5 at a sale for this book and thatâ€™s about all I would spend on it.
