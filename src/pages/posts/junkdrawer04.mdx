Corvallis Science Pub

I shot this story last week and it was my last shoot for the school year. I’ll be taking time off to study abroad in Japan, but will return to The Daily Barometer fall term. Luckily I was able to go out on a high note and went to a cool event about beer. It was the 1st Corvallis Science Pub held in conjunction with OMSI. The topic was the history and science of beer. I’m not much into drinking, but brewing sounds interesting. This lecture even had glass jars with different kinds of hops, barely, and beer. The jars traveled around the room as people took in the essence of brewing good beer.

Getting the Shot:
This was certainly one of the more interesting things I’ve shot recently. The room was very crowded, but I was able to move around quite a bit and everyone was being nice because I had the big camera! I basically shooting with the usual combo with a SB-800 bouncing of the ceiling. After getting the typical talking head shots I wanted something of the little glasses they had on the tables. Thinking about it, a photo of someone actually looking at it, or smelling it would be nice.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikon SB-800
Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8
