_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />
just finished watching "China from the Inside" a 4 part program on PBS. "Shifting Nature" part 3 of 4 is about the pollution of China's waterways and their plan to pump massive amounts of water from southern to northern China.
It was insane the amount of pollution within their waterways. It was said that 50% of Chinas waterways are classified as being level 4 and above with 5 being unsuitable for humans to use (swim, drink, etc.). Luckily there are environmental activist in China doing research and fighting with lawsuits, doing everything they can to help restore a natural balance in China.

Most everyone nowadays is talking about China taking over the US, but I don't know if that's possible. While they are the most populous country, they have incredible amounts of pollution related health problems. Some cities are even called "cancer cities" because the cancer rate is so high.

This is a lesson to the whole world that when you exploit the earth and don't take care of nature and your people bad things will come. So help out in every way you can by at least recycling and using recycled products.
