_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

his book is really a nice quick read which really has no focus. Well I take that back the focus seems
to be on leading a more positive life. Not necessarily making better decisions, but being more content
with your decisions.

When I first picked up the book I expected a pro cannabis book criticizing the United States and it’s drug policies with a little comedy thrown in. And while several times he makes this argument (sometimes rambling a little too much) there is much more to this book.

I think Tommy decided to write this book to tell his life’s story and how he has changed after the “Pipe Dreams” raid. While for some people this book might be all over the place I enjoy the “stoner” mind stream of jumping from one insightful story to one thrilling story. This book doesn’t drag on much (except his 4-5 rants on the screwed up bush administration) and I think the length is perfect. It only takes a few nights of reading.

I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind or interests in the man behind the stoner from “Up in Smoke” and his other movies.

Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
