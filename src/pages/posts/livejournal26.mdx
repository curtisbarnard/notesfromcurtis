_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

esterday I conquered the longest hike/walk I've ever been on. I walked about 4.5 miles to bald hill from
my apartment and then hiked 1-1.5 miles up to the top of bald hill. The hike there wasn't bad. I did
have my day pack with me, but I was only carrying a sweater, coat, hat, gloves, a couple sandwiches,
a tripod, a couple bottles of water, and my camera. Not very heavy. I was also listening to some podcasts
on the way to the park, I'm pretty far behind on them all so I'm trying to catch up. Once I got to the
bottom of the hill I wasn't even exhausted. I climbed up and sat on a bench at the top, yet to be very
tired. Snapped some pictures and just relaxed for 45 minutes or so. It was awesome up top, the view would
be even better at night so I plan to do that trip soon. After I was done up top I began my trip down.
The slope and doing the little downhill shuffle type walk (you know what I'm talking about if your a
hiker) killed my feet. I wasn't physically tired yet, but my feet began to burn and I still had 4+ miles
left on the pavement! I was about 3/4 of the way back when the exhaustion set in. I was in the "put your
feet in front of each other and keep moving" mode. It was terrible, I've never experienced anything like
it before. Once I got home I took a shower and just laid around. That damn hike was one of the craziest,
but most satisfying thing I've ever done. I'll go on a long hike again, but I'm not sure how soon.

Oh yeah the photo was taken at the top facing south west toward Philomath (fill-low-muth).

Peace-Curtis
