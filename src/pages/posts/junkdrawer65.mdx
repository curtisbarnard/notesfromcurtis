_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

his was from the Oregon State Fair a few weeks ago. My girlfriend went on the ride, but I couldn’t. Too
scary. I don’t know how many people have died on this style of ride or how often the chains have broken,
but just the thought of it happening is enough to keep me away.

It was fun to go to the fair, but it’s definitely not worth the money. Or maybe it’s better to go once every 5-10 years. I remember going when I was little and I thought it would be fun. The main “fair” wasn’t. The rides are all the typical quick setup rides that teeter and totter and are on the verge of breaking off and flying into unsuspecting bystanders. Even the gondola seemed smaller than what I remember. The highlight of the fair was playing some bocce (pronounced Ba-Chi or so says dictionary.com) ball. I recently read about the game in “The I Chong” and I’ve been interested in playing it since. It was definitely fun and I want to play some more in the future.

So I guess it was fun to go this year because it will be another 10 before I go again.
