_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

y girlfriend and I found ourselves with some rare time together so we decided to head for a date downtown. After checking out yelp and looking for a new place we hadn’t tried we came across the listing for Old World Deli. Mr. E. gave it 5 stars so we thought we should try it out.

I was pleasantly delighted by our decision to eat there for lunch. Sandwiches ranged from $6-7 and were mostly the old classics, with a few custom sandwiches. I got the Mediterranean on whole wheat and my girlfriend got the mighty meaty on light rye. I preferred the might meaty, but the Mediterranean was still good. The sandwiches also come with tortilla chips which is a nice crunchy contrast to the soft sandwiches.

The staff was great, with both friendly and speedy service. Finally the surroundings were awkward. I’m not really into the whole European thing, but I would much rather be there than a boring McDonald’s. Plus all the paintings and various artifacts are great conversation pieces.

In brief if you’ve eaten at most of the famous places around Corvallis and are looking for a new place to go, head over to Old World Deli.
