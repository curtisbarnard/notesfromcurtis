_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

liked this book as it was a good read on a topic which has the ability to be over written. The book covers
the philosophy of guerrilla gardening, has a few pictures, and numerous accounts from other people involved
in guerrilla gardening. I feel the accounts are the strong point of this book as it has community garden
leaders, public officials, and other peoples views on guerrilla gardening. It really gives you a good
basis on the issue of greening our cities. Thereâ€™s also a lot of info on potential grow sites, asking
permission, recommended plants, and many other gardening basics.

The weak point of this book is the lack of color photographs and illustrations. I know that guerrilla gardening is pretty straight forward, but inclusion of pictures can really help get the juices flowing.
