# Wary one

Right at dawn,  
PMD's hatch,  
over the water,  
I wait for,  
yhem to float by,  
I will silently sip.

Deeper down I go,  
it is hot,  
nothing to eat,  
Yet hungry,  
a flash I give chase,  
caught by a fisherman.  

Yet he is,  
nice enough,  
he lets me go,  
off to repeat,  
this day tomorrow.
