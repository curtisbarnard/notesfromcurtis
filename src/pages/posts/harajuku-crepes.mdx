If your in Harajuku or Shibuya then crepes will abound. They are expensive, ranging from ￥ 350-￥ 500, but are sooo good. My favorite would have to be the ice cream one’s and the one in the photo was particularly good. It was a strawberry-chocolate-cookie ice cream crepe, and they even put some corn flakes or something in there to give it a nice crunch. So what if I look girly eating a crepe, let alone a crepe out of a pink cone, but I’m surely more happy than people passing by. Are they enjoying the holy combination of sweet ingredients all wrapped in a thin pancake like wrap? NO!

Japan is the kingdom of sweets, with everything from sweet melon bread, to the most pristine strawberries. So for a sweet lover like me it’s paradise, but the paradise come’s at a cost. They seem to take their sweets very seriously and so sometimes things can get quite expensive. Most of the time I’m forced to just stare, drool, and try to keep my hand from reaching for my wallet. Once in a while it’s nice to splurge on a slice of heaven though.
