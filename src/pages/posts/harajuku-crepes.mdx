_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while studying abroad in Japan. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />f your in Harajuku or Shibuya then crepes will abound. They are expensive,
ranging from ￥ 350-￥ 500, but are sooo good. My favorite would have to be the ice cream one’s and
the one in the photo was particularly good. It was a strawberry-chocolate-cookie ice cream crepe,
and they even put some corn flakes or something in there to give it a nice crunch. So what if I look
girly eating a crepe, let alone a crepe out of a pink cone, but I’m surely more happy than people
passing by. Are they enjoying the holy combination of sweet ingredients all wrapped in a thin
pancake like wrap? NO!

Japan is the kingdom of sweets, with everything from sweet melon bread, to the most pristine strawberries. So for a sweet lover like me it’s paradise, but the paradise come’s at a cost. They seem to take their sweets very seriously and so sometimes things can get quite expensive. Most of the time I’m forced to just stare, drool, and try to keep my hand from reaching for my wallet. Once in a while it’s nice to splurge on a slice of heaven though.
