This past Sunday I went to take some photos for an article about the OSU Flying Club. The weather was looking iffy as the cloud cover was low and there was lots of rain. The reporter and I weren’t sure if we would be going up in the plane, fortunately a nice break in the weather came. After the pilot did all the pre-flight checks on the Cessna 172, we hopped in, put on our seat belts and radios, and prepared for the ride. I can say it was pretty cool to above Corvallis, a perspective not seen often by most people. Plus the clouds went away a bit and provided some dramatic scenery in the coast range. After an hour in the air we came in for a smooth landing, thanked the pilot, and left Corvallis airport.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikon D90
Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8
Sigma 10-20mm f/4

Getting the Shot:
This photo was taken with the D300 and 17-55mm f/2.8. The interior of the plane had some nice embroidery including “Oregon State Flying Club”. All i had to do was turn around and snap the shot. The photo on the barometer site of the pilot was taken with the D90 and Sigma 10-20mm f/4. I was considering selling this lens, but it’s a good thing i didn’t. That extra reach out to 10mm makes a huge difference and can really get an interesting perspective.
