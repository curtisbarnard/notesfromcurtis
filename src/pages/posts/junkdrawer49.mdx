Saturday night the Ducks came to town, they came to win, but the beavers spanked them. The first half of the game was poor for the beavers. Simply put they were getting outplayed by the ducks. After gathering themselves together they came back with a vengeance. There must have been a period of five to six minutes where the ducks didn’t score a single point. After getting over their problems earlier in the game, it was an easy win.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8

Getting the Shot:
I originally brought the 50mm f/1.4 along with me in hopes of getting some nice layup shots. When i went to put it on the camera and tried to focus, it was stuck! So something is wrong with that lens and i can’t use it. Back to the old 80-200. I was still happy with the shots i got that night. I shot up in the stands for a while and got some decent one’s, but i couldn’t pass up posting this photo. A great breakaway layup from Talisa Rhea.
