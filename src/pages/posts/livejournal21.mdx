_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ren't they just too cute? This is a photo from my walk two days ago. It wasn't just a walk for walks sake like I planned to do, but my girlfriend and I walked to the theater to see the new Indiana Jones movie. The movie was good, but not awesome. Definitely doesn't stick with the typical Indiana Jones style of plot. Anyway after the movie we began to walk home, but decided to walk over to a little pond/storm water runoff area where the ducks hang out. Well the babies were out and were a great photo subject. They remind me of my chickens that I got a year ago. Baby birds are just so cute. That's the photo of the day, I hope you enjoyed it.

Peace-Curtis
