I have to admit i enjoy riding the MAX or streetcar. Looking at the people riding it with me; business suits, skaters, teenage bums, Christians, high school students, bikers, hip hop aficionados, and any other type of person. Really it is an enjoyable mode of transportation in Portland.

The first time you think about rail transportation in a community it seems a little akward. Why would someone pay so much to go such a little distance? Even if they had a “fareless square” that would put the city in debt. Think about it this way, a fareless square will encourage more people to come to the area, therefore attracting businesses. These businesses pay taxes and help the community (at least that what a good responsible LOCAL business will do).

Having a good efficeint means of transportain which does not use cars is key to our future communities. Imagine a nice working organism of a community. Really that’s the ideal communtiy. Everything and everybody works together and the economy sustains itself. It doesn’t have to rely on the outside world to supply the goods and services poeple need. I know it’s a dream, but it could a be a reality in the future.
