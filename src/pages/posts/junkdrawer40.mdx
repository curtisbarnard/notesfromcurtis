_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

his book was a great journey through nature, society, and the inner being. The movie and book have both
had a lot of controversy surrounding them. With many people calling Chris a fool and the book glorifying
his mistakes, and others idolizing Chris and wishing they could go on their own journey. And while I
can see how people would get both of these views I don’t think the book is either.

I think the author did an excellent job at telling the story of Chris. You feel like your going down the river, working in the cornfields, and enjoying Alaska’s wilderness. Mixed in with Chris’s story are some of the authors own and other peoples similar journey’s. I think these add to the book a lot. They help you see a little more into the type of person Chris was.

If you approach this book with a level head and open mind you will enjoy it. Read it and think about who Chris was, why he went on this journey, and what did he do wrong. Don’t idolize him for what he did. Don’t criticize him for who he was. Accept the fact that he was and that he experienced things in life most never will. Enjoy walking into the wild.
