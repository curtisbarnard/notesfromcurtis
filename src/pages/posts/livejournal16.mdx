_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

**"Change your incandescent bulbs out for fluorescent bulbs."**

<DropCap letter='O' />

k we have another simple one because I am swamped with school work!

This has been stated by many sources, but iIshould still reiterate that fluorescent bulbs use less power, and they last far longer than incandescents. Remember to get those fluoro's and especially now because they have developed more natural light styled fluoro's. Yay, no more icky fluoro color.
