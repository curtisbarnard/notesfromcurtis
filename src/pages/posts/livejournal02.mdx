_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ell right now I am in the process of learning Japanese, I've been learning for about 2 weeks now. I'm constantly looking for people to chat with in Japanese (or at least attempt to). I have almost memorized hiragana and I'm starting on katakana. If there is anyone out there that would like to help me it would be much appreciated.

ありがとう！！！！
