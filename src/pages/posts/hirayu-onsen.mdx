uring my time studying abroad in Japan I only went to an onsen once (maybe twice?) and I don't remember it being very fancy or much different from a [sento](/posts/kyoto-sento) or the [ofuro]() at the dorm.

On every subsequent trip that I've gone back to Japan well, except for when I went there for just a weekend. I've made a point to go to some Onsen. When I knew we were going to be going back and we would be near Nagoya and going back to Tokyo I had to of course find some nuance and to visit. So I just did some googling on Google maps and found that there was okahida on sin between takayama and matsamoto. And I usually prefer to get off the beaten path. However, this time knowing that I would be with my kid and it might be harder to. Delete last sentence. So I did some research about what ryokan were in the area and their prices and how nice the baths looked because I was able to use points I decided to book with meama. Getting there was an hour bus ride from takayama through the mountains which was pretty and even though it was mid-april, there was still some patches of snow on the ground when we arrived. The town is pretty sleepy and has some more modern buildings as well as construction was going on for what it look like to be a pretty modern Onsen. I'm not really into this look as much and I pretty much measure every Onsen in town against kurocawa Onsen which tram and I visited in 2015. However, the Rio con that we were staying at had great little tatami rooms. We had our own personal indoor Onsen bath and it has several other baths and the styling is done very well. It doesn't exactly feel like really old in times, but it does feel Japanese. 

The weather had been a little iffy since arriving in Japan with the previous day at the F1 race being pretty sunny and hot. In the evening it started raining and didn't stop until middle of the next day. It was a torrential downpour but honestly I wasn't upset. There's nothing like sitting in your room drinking tea with the window open and listening to the rain. We're heading over to Hot spring bath while cold rain falls on you and you just soak the world's troubles away. 

Once the rain lit up we decided to have a walk around the town. As I mentioned before, there's a bunch of more modern buildings which take away from the feeling a little bit, but luckily there's a nice little museum with a couple of old batched roof buildings as well as a free public Onsen outdoor Onsen.

Tram headed for the female bath as Norris and I went to the male one. The entrance is a little wooden shack of a changing room. I can still here the rattle of glass and wood as your slide the door open then shut. Striped down and or belongings placed in cubbies we headed out to the bath. There is no shower at this bath so you just use a bucket to pour so hot springs water over yourself.

Norris enjoyed this bath even though it was a bit hot for him. I mostly let him sit on my lap as a rain drop here and there landed on us. He had a wife smile on his face as he played with the buckets.
