_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

**"When using paper towels to dry your hands use as little as possible."**

<DropCap letter='W' />

hen you go to a public bathroom and you wash your hands please wait and think a second before you dry your hands. Instead of taking a wad of 5-10 paper towels try taking 1 or 2. Slow down and try not to be in a rush, thoroughly cleaning your hands. It's not only healthy to completely dry your hands, but by slowing down you can use less paper. Yipeeeeee!
