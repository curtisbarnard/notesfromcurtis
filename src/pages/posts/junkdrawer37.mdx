_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

his book is great as a read on it’s own or a conversation starter with friends. Want to know how to make a carrot pipe? What about making cannabutter? Not sure what kush is? This book will get you started on the never ending cannabis culture.

The one downside to a book like this is it’s lifespan. While i’m sure a lot of the information will be relevant for a long time to come some of it wont. With the development of new strains, smoking techniques, and slang the only way to be up on the jargon is to be a stoner yourself.

Honestly $14 for this book is a steal. So if you want to be educated on the stoner species or you just want something to stare at while your high this book should be in your collection.

Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
