_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

onnichiwa readers,

Yesterday on campus Toyota had a whole hybrid information fair station thing set up. It consist of a huge 18 wheeler that had an interactive exhibit inside, some hybrids on display and an area where you could drive the Toyota hybrids (Prius, Camry, and highlander I think). I went in and checked out the exhibit inside.

The first thing as you walk in a worker greets you and ask if you have anything with a bar code on it and scans it. You can now scan this bar code at each exhibit and earn points. With the points you can earn 1 of three prizes depending on the amount of points you earn. A recycled pencil, a tree planted in your name, or a Faraday flashlight (one that has no batteries and is shaken to create electricity). BTW I got the flashlight it's cool! :D Anyway back to the exhibit. I really knew everything they presented there and I found that most of the info was biased toward hybrid vehicles and really had no mention of completely battery powered vehicles. I really am glad that Toyota does things like this, but it irks me somewhat to know that they have the resources to build far better cars and they don't.

If Chevy could created a ZEV electric vehicle practically a decade ago why don't they just make them again? They can spew all the bullshit about no market, but that's just horse shit. There have been other cars created with far less of a market than an electric vehicle. I just think it's about time to start building electric vehicles. Stop the bullshit Toyota and Honda! As much as I think you're far ahead of Germany and USA on enviro-friendly cars why not go the extra step and go full electric!!!!
