_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while in college. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ull of the Woods Wilderness is located just south of Bagby Hot Springs and east of Opal Creek Wilderness
and is relatively lightly tracked area. It contains lowland old growth forest, steep 60 to 90 degree
slopes, and even the famous northern spotted owl. While doing a quick online search I even found out
that “Bull of the Woods” is old logging slang for the best/most experienced logger in the woods.

My most recent foray into the woods was in the Bull of the Woods area. On a sunny afternoon Tram and I set off on trail #544 from Elk lake headed for Twin lakes. The overgrown trail quickly climbs up to 4400′ while giving some fleeting views of Mt. Jefferson and Elk Lake. Then the trail turns and heads north along the side of a ridge and past several mosquito infested ponds. With the surrounding hills becoming bathed in the late afternoon glow we picked up our pace to make it to camp before nightfall.

The was 30 minutes of light remaining when we arrived at the western Twin Lake. We quickly set up the tent, constantly slapping mosquitoes off our faces, and then just as quickly started a fire to try and smoke them out. This area of the cascades is infamous for the clouds of bloodsuckers who keep campers tent bound for days, luckily it was still a bit early in the season and we were able to brave the little buggers and hang out by the fire. Later that evening after dinner I set my camera up to take a star trail photo of the lake, seen above, and returned to camp to lounge around waiting for the camera to finish. With heavy eyelids I stumbled to the edge of the lake to retrieve the camera. Then stumbled back just as clumsily and fell into bed.

The next morning the sun was shining early, providing ample light to cook breakfast by. The forest around had a idyllic look in which a fairy from FernGully could fly out at any moment. After packing up camp we took a refreshing dip in the lake, just as the day was beginning to heat up. The water had a shallow layer of warmth on top and so it was necessary to swim like a crocodile, trying not to lift your body out of the water, but not let it go too deep. Reluctantly we dressed and got back on the trail headed for the car.

The hike out was equally as nice as the hike in. There were many distant views, blooming rhododendrons, hellful mosquitoes, and the pristine Oregon mountain air. I swear they could bottle that stuff up and sell it on the east coast. Joking aside I’ve never breathed fresher air than in the pacific northwest, hopefully we will continue to take our environment seriously here and keep in beautiful for all to experience.

Twenty four hours after we left the car with heavy packs, we jogged down the last hill towards the car. We’d only seen one other group the entire time, leaving us to recharge before heading back to city life. As the car slithered back and forth between potholes, my mind drifted off cycling through the great adventures I’d already had in Oregon this year. Some say to not dwell on the past, but I say cherish the great things because when it’s all coming to an end all you’ll have are those memories.
