import MoviesTable from '../../components/MoviesTable.astro';

I've watched a lot of movies and definitely not kept track of what I've seen or what I liked. I'm trying to keep better track of that now so I can go back to old favorites or give solid recommendations to friends. Rating is out of five with five being the highest, no halves or quarters, that's for chumps.
