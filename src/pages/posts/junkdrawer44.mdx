_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />t took me a bit to finish the book as I'm in school and it’s not quite a book
that makes you want to keep reading. Although it was a nice book and never really dull.

I decided to give the book 4 stars for the fact that it probably wouldn’t be very enjoyable unless you’ve been to Yellowstone. I've been to Yellowstone probably 7-8 times and I know my way around the main park and some of the back country. Reading the book I'm constantly reminded of the places I've gone in the park and the descriptions of the landscapes are very accurate.

I'd recommend this book if you’ve either been to Yellowstone, or are interested in the park. It gives a good feeling of what it might have been like to be there during the first years of the parks life.
