A lovely ride…
Sunday, July 13th, 2008

Yesterday i decided to go on a bike ride around Corvallis to check out potential guerrilla gardening spots. I do have to say that it turned out to be a lovely ride. After doing to recon i went by the library to drop of my books and continued riding towards Philomath to look at a churches community garden.  Riding on the side walk i came across this sight, but i can’t decided which actual picture i like the most:

Which do you like?

After a good photography session i stopped next over at animal sciences on the OSU campus. Outside they have horses and i saw this beautiful one. He/she came over while i took pictures and talk to her/him.

It was a welcome suprise. I’m not a horse person, but enjoyed hanging out talking and taking pictures. I continued my journey after a few mintues and finally reached the community garden:

There were a few people tending to there plots and a few more showed up over time. I asked them a few questions and took some pictures of the plots. This Tomatillo was my favorite of the bunch:

As if the bike ride wasn’t enough i came across a bizarre sight. As i rode through the MU quad i started to see sign’s with lights around them blinking. You know the sign’s that are on old theaters. I saw a bright light shining on some people making a ruckus and moving about. A lady came up to me and explained it was rehearsal for the midsummer nights dream play, which would begin showing this wednesday.

I figured i couldn’t get anymore lucky with random events and so rode home thinking to myself “i need to get out and ride more…”
