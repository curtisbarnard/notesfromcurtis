_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='A' />

couple days ago I decided to go on a walk or bike ride once a day and take my camera. Then I would upload my favorite photo from the excursion to here and talk about it. Well I’ve done everything but upload the photos for the past couple days so I’ll try to post a few pictures today.

I’ll give you guys more than one photo today though as an apology for not uploading a couple days ago. First my girlfriend and I went out to eat at Tommy’s 4th Street Bar & Grill. I wrote a review for them over at yelp. If you click their name above it’ll take you to their review page. Here’s a little excerpt from my review:

“Cajun fries where pretty good. I’ve never had fries like them before. Prices where about $2-3 more than what I think the food was worth.”

After that we walked around downtown a little bit. We went to the top of the Corvallis Towers, which are 6 stories tall! Ha ha, anyway it was a nice view so I think we might go to the restaurant sometime this summer. I’ll take my camera and get some nice night shots of the city.

We then started to head back home, but stopped by a Central park downtown. We had a good time with all the other little kids there. We slid down the slide, swung on the swings, and rocked on the spring rocker thingies. I’ve always loved going to parks, there’s just something about letting all inhibitions go and being a kid again. So while my girlfriend was swinging I took out the Sigma 10-20mm and snapped a photo of her. Looks like good fun doesn’t it? Man already this post is taking a while to type what with all the alignment of photos and such.

After the park we continued our journey onward. While walking we had been looking at plants in peoples yards and I was looking out for a good plant to photograph. We finally came across some stunning irises. I decided to use the 50mm f/1.4 and tried to get the detail in focus and let everything else just fade out. What do you think? Does it work? I think it’s my favorite photo of the day. I really love the colors, even though it’s a sort of dark blueish/purplish and should give off a depressing feel it makes me happy!

WOW! I need to be a little more descriptive because it’s fairly hard to write enough so the photos line up well. This would be far easier with one photo, I guess this can be my motivation to make a post a day with one photo. Back to the story at hand. After wandering through people's front yards looking around for good photo opportunities we went to Borders to have a nice read. I don’t know what you guys are like, but I love going to book stores and just browsing around. I’m a HUGE book guy and I own a fair amount of books, but I can always have more. I always want more information and books are a great source. Another reason book stores are fun is to watch people. You can look at people and guess what books they will read and they might surprise you by reading something totally random. Well this guy was reading what I would expect him to read. Manga. I’m not a huge manga fan, I do own a couple, but they are real Japanese versions for my own study I guess. I don’t know manga has never really captured me the way anime has. I think this guy would beg to differ though. Plenty of other kids and adults roam about borders reading manga too. It’s surprising to see how popular it is now.

Finally I’m on the home stretch! I can see the finish. Let’s see I guess I should tell ya’ll I’m a big drug advocate. I believe all drugs should be legal. I’m not just some young punk that wants to get wasted all the time. I just think drugs should be legal to use in the privacy of your own home on your own body. Drugs do not hurt anyone but the user and in the “land of the free” citizens ought to have the right to use drugs. One of the sections I regularly visit when at a book store is the drug section. This visit I was reading Cannabible 3 By Jason King, which by the way was very interesting. While I was reading the book though I realized I was one isle from the kids section. I couldn’t believe they would put the sections so close together. I mean I don’t really think it’s a bad thing, but I would assume a company like borders would realize their book placement. At least some complainer would come along and yell at Borders for doing such an irresponsible thing, alas the books still remain though. I snapped the photo of the Cannabible one top of some kids books, but I used too much bokeh. Oh well I could have done better on the photo, but I still like it. Well folks that’s were this story ends. I hope you enjoyed the journey and please watch your step when exiting this blog.

Peace-Curtis
