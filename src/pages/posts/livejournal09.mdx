_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

eah had my drafting class today and had to spend the 5 hours before class finishing homework. Christ almighty drafting is intense, time consuming wise that is. On the way back from class snapped a quick picture of the Memorial Union:

It's pretty later at night because it's all lit up and no one is around, I'll get a good picture sometime.

I also did my advising today for next term. Sent an e-mail to head of the Japanese language department to inquire about minoring in Japanese.

Yeah I really have no news, no profound thoughts today, nothing exciting.
