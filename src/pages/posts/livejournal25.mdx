_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

or today's walk I went down to a local school. It was a short walk compared to yesterday's 9 miles and blisters. Tomorrow i'm planning a 10-11 mile walk so I deserved a bit of rest. Anyway I went to the school with the intention of getting a cool moving clouds at night shot. I did get one indeed. I like the shot, it's not awesome, but i'm satisfied. Well until tomorrow that's all.

Peace-Curtis
