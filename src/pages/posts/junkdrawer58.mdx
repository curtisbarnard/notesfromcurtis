_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

his is one of the photos from a recent trip to Newport, OR. I'm also testing the "blog this" feature
on flickr to post this without logging into wordpress.

Anyway this was taken at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area which is just 30-40 min. south of Newport. My girlfriend and I were finishing up photographing the sunset near the beach. We started hiking up the trail towards the car at devil's churn. This window appeared and the colors were just as you see them in this photo.
