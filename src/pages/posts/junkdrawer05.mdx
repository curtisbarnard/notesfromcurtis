_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

nly 6 days left until I'm in Japan. Wow time seems to have gone by so quickly. Today I'm finishing up my last final exam and then the next couple days I'll be moving everything out of my apartment. Finally I just need to make sure I have everything packed up and I'll be ready to go. I think I have almost everything for my trip except for a couple things, a plug adapter and some white undershirts. Oh I even got some business cards, this way I can keep in contact with people I meet while abroad.

Before I leave I would like to put out a vLog, hopefully in HD, but I've been trying to get all the editing software to work properly. I think I've finally got it, so now I just need to record some stuff and I should have a video up by this weekend. That's it for now…
