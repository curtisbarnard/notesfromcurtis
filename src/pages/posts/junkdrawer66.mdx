The night before my Dad left we took a short trip out to Yokohama. I had school until 2:40pm and then went back to the dorm to pick up pops. Once in Yokohama we headed past Yokohama Stadium and then into China town. The China town is the largest in Japan and pretty famous. We wondered haphazardly for a while, staring at the huge steamed buns, gyoza, roasted nuts, and some sort of weird looking soup. The soup looked almost like tomato soup with a weird white cone thing in it. Dad stopped by Starbucks to get his hip, cultured, and worldly coffee and then headed in the direction of the waterfront.

We got to the waterfront as the sun began to set. It started off with a lovely pink and then intensified a bit to a more orange color. Then the color began to fade and I started putting my camera away. This was a mistake, as the sun dropped lower than the clouds and began to light the sky up in a brilliant orange. It was the best sunset I’ve seen in Japan and probably one of the best in my life. The color was extremely intense, far beyond what words could describe or pictures could show. Once the sun finally dropped below the horizon we turned back towards the station.

While walking through china town again we discovered what the mystery soup was; Shark fin soup. I’d had always heard about it, but what I pictured in my mind was something far different. The stuff was expensive too, $50 for a plate. I’m curious to try some controversial dishes here in Japan (whale, horse, fugu), but the shark fin did not whet my appetite.

On the train back home we talked about various issues in Japan. Things different from America. My Dad was going through the period of intense learning when exposed to a new culture. He was full of questions and always observing everything. I laughed to myself as I remember be more like that when I first arrived, but it’s different now. I’ve settled into that daily type of grind that comes with school, work, or any other scheduled commitment. I know there is a chunk out of everyday where I will do the same thing: school. Fortunately I’ve been trying to go somewhere new everyday after school and I’ve been doing good to keep my motivation. I’ve only got so much time left and I gotta see all sorts of cool things! “Insert lame 90’s thumbs up, happy, motivated expression”
