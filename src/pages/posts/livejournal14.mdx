_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

**"Instead of turning on the light, open the shades/blinds!"**

<DropCap letter='T' />

hat's right folks you can simply open your shades or blinds and have free light!!! (depending on time of day and weather conditions) Even if the natural light isn't really bright try to get by with it.

I don't know about you all, but I would much rather have natural light shining on me than yucky fluorescent or super yellow incandescents (which you shouldn't have in the first place :smile:). So remember folks use all the natural light you can to your advantage.

Until tomorrow, keep it green!
