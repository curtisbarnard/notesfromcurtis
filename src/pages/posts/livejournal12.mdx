_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ell I'm back and I have more information to post. First I wanna say I really have a lot of things going through my head, but for some reason it is hard for me to put on paper (or rather computer screen) so I'm sorry this blog does not consist of more. Now I want to get on to the main topic of this post.

## Sustainability

I've been into the whole sustainability movement since I was a child, but for the past year I have really been motivated. Maybe the price of oil, or this administrations lack of respect for the environment, or maybe it is even my love of being out in the garden. Actually all these are contributing factors of my decision to try and reduce my impact on the earth.

By no means am I a saint when it comes to living green, but I try to do everything I can when I remember. I am a believer that you don't have to give up everything and go all green, but everyone should try to at least reduce their impact somehow. Besides, the satisfaction that is gained from knowing you saved some money, or helped the environment is great.

I am a very diverse person or I should say that I have a diverse group of friends. I know hippies, skateboarders, republicans, hardcore hunters, fly-fishermen, radical Christians, and so on. Having such a diverse group of people that surround me I believe it is my duty to educate these people on living sustainable. I let them know they don't have to be hippyies or liberals to recycle or chose organic food. I try to make it clear that buying local products helps the local economy, and that whenever possible you should try to stay away from huge corporations. While I do try to educate at any point possible I try to stay respectful. Being disrespectful is a common error most environmentalist make.

To try and get your message across you can't push your beliefs onto them, all you can do is offer an opinion and some facts to back it up. We all know that a forceful person does nothing to persuade us, thats why we need to be witty and find ways to get people thinking. Yelling, or making someone feel as if they are stupid accomplishes nothing, all that is necessary is to plant a seed of thought in someones brain.

I'm trying to educate non-environmentalist, but I am also trying to educate environmentalist on how to spread the word and get a point across. Please be respectful and don't give us greenies a bad name, think of a brainy more effective way to get your point across.

Thats all for this rant.

Peace and Love - Curtis

PS- From this point forward I will try to post a green tip everyday.
