My latest online addiction is vimeo. They allow people to upload HD videos so there is some great stuff on there. This one below i thought was pretty cool:


Teton Daydreaming from piton productions on Vimeo.

I think it was shot using a remote controlled helicopter. However it was shot though it’s pretty cool. A nice look around the Tetons from an eagles perspective. I’ll probably be posting more stuff from vimeo in the future as i’ve found some proffesional quality stuff on there.
