_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ust watched invisible children and it's a pretty good movie, well shot for first time documenters. I would recommend you at least see it once as it is only 1 hour long and I'm sure your life is not too busy.

What I'm about to say next has caught me and probably will catch me a lot of flak.

Despite the crazy stuff shown in this movie I don't know whether to say I want to support the cause or that don't. There are other things going on in the world, maybe not as severe, but everything needs it's attention right?

What about domestic issues in America should we take priority over them and go save people in Africa? I think and always have thought Iraq was the biggest mistake America has made. We all know the reasons why we aren't involved in Africa, theres no oil for the corporations or money to make. Even though giving a huge amount of aid to Africa would be legitimate would it really be the best thing for America to do?

This is the saying that I have, well not so much a saying as a thought. Things like disease, war, and natural disasters are all population control. When things go out of balance nature will always correct that. We are humans and we are part of nature, just because we build concrete jungles and are smarter than other animals doesn't mean we are above nature. Our time will come and that is natures decision when the end of us will be.

I like movies like this a lot because it evokes thought, deep very conflicting thought and I think everyone should think about the issues in our world. It's hard though to make decisions on such important topics.

What do you think?
