Guerrilla Gardening

Please Water MeA few weeks ago i was at Grass Roots Bookstore in downtown Corvallis and came across a book called “Guerrilla Gardening: A Manualfesto”. I flipped through the pages looking for any interesting pictures or passages to read as i usually do when i browse a bookstore. I read about things called seed bombs and how to get plants for cheap(or free). Unfortunately the store was closing so i had to put the book down. I wanted more though.

A week later i found a site called guerillagardening.org and the owner of the site also published a book called “On Guerilla Gardening: A Handbook For Gardening Without Boundries”. I browsed the site and forum, finding links to other sites and stories about guerrilla gardening. I’m now addicted.

I’m currently keeping a keen eye as i walk or bike around Corvallis. I know there is ugly space, i see it all the time. I’m planning in my head what to plant and how to plant. What will happen if i get caught?

Overgrow the world…
