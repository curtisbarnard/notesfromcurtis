_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='I' />

just got my new lens in the mail and I've been playing with it. So far I'm very pleased especially because I only paid $100 for the lens. I've never used the ED version and I'm sure it's better then my non-ED version, but for $100 I couldn't pass this lens up. So far the only flaws I can tell with my copy are the usage dings and scratches on the barrel and the stiffer focusing ring. If anyone else has a manual focus Nikkor 180mm, how is the focusing? Is it stiffer than other lenses? I'm tempted to think it's suppose to be stiffer so you can get a more accurate focus point, but who knows.

Also this lens is fairly big and heavy, about the same size as my 105mm micro VR. I doubt this will keep me from using it though as I plan to use ALL my lenses a ton while in Japan. I'll be hauling my big ass backpack full of lenses around, which should help me get in better shape.

Honestly I'm just happy that I was able to get a lens in this focal length before I left for Japan. I was planning on getting an Ai-S version, but other lens deals appeared and soon I didn't have any money left for a 180mm lens. Luckily I found this beauty while surfing one of the photography forums I frequent. I love life and how everything always seems to work itself out.
