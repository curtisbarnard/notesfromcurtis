_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

**"Always use silver wear when possible, if you have to use plastic wash is and reuse it."**

<DropCap letter='O' />

ops forgot to post a tip so here's a quick one, as I need to go to bed.

Simple and effective the quote basically explains itself. If your at a party try to use silver wear and collect any plastic wear and wash it.

Thanks for keeping the earth green.
