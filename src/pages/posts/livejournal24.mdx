_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

oday I walked to school like I've been doing so lately. I took the camera along hoping to catch something.
There were lots of flowers out because it's spring obviously.

But I saw some street art which I think is a little more interesting for today. Too many flowers lately. Anyway I really enjoy street art even though it's against the law and damages peoples property. I dunno what do you think? Do you like street art? I think it's more impressive for me because of the risk that is being taken and the speed that is required. That's it for now.
