_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

don’t even remember how I came across this book, but it was definitely a good read. Not 5 stars as the book was a little repetitive and slow at times, but definitely 4 stars. The book is another of the typical “I’m going to change my life and write about it plus add in statistics and side stories and such”. Which is fine because I like books like this. I felt that one of the strongest points of this book were the short essays and recipes from the authors husband and daughter. These helped the book move along and provided a break from all the local food statistics and preaching. If your interested in reading about local food, gardening, and rural east coast life this book would be for you.

Rating: 4 stars out of 5
