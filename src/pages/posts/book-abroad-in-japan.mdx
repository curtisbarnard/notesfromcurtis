must have read some blog post or Reddit thread where someone recommended this book. I had seen a couple of Chris Broad's videos over the years, but wasn't a subscriber or frequent viewer. 

Since a possible move to Japan in the next few years has been on my mind, I've been looking to read about other people's experiences living there. This book didn't totally fulfill that need as Chris moved there as a JET, which I have no intention of doing. The book was good though at humanizing and setting up the origin story of a huge YouTube personality. I appreciated that he'd made friends when he was just a lowly JET teaching assistant and those friends continue to show up in his YouTube videos to this day.

Overall not what I was looking for, nor full of any big insights, but it was an enjoyable, easy read that I finished in a few days.

Rating: 4 stars out of 5
