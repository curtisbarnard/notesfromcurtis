_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

alls are ridiculous. I don't care what type of mall it is I hate it, I hate the stores, I hate the attitudes of people in the mall, I hate the parking. Alas I must go shopping with my girlfriend so she can find a suit for work. Instead of being pissed off I figure I might as well find a way to have fun. The result...me in sunglasses:
