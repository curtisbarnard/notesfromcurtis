_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

he person who I borrowed this book from said they didn’t like it much. I was expecting a boring bookabout hiking, but was surprised with an incredible journey. I only wish the book was longer!

One reason I think this book is good is the length of the hike. While the author had to cover a decent amount of mileage a day he did not need to speed as much as PCT hikers do. This allows the author to linger a bit, interact with people and things, and really relay his thoughts onto paper.

The book really does cover as many topics as the different landscapes across Oregon. I’ve been blessed to travel around a lot of Oregon and know how much the animals, people, and plants change from one part of the state to another. Bill does a good job of changing topics from one section of the hike to the next. You really feel as if your hiking with him.

I only hope to take a journey like this sometime soon in my life.
