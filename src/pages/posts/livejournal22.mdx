_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

esterday I walked to school instead of my usual biking or driving. It took around 28 minutes which isn't
bad at all and it allows me to listen to the podcast that I follow. Right now i'm following TokyoCalling
which isn't updated too often, but i'm listening to the back episodes. I'm on 82 of 119, so i'm getting
close to catching up. It's not the type of podcast that I expected, but I really enjoy Scott's voice
and he usually talks about interesting things. So go give it a listen and see what you think. After classes
my girlfriend came over to campus on her bike and we were going to walk around. I'd been wanting to head
to Fairbanks hall and check out the art gallery so we headed that way. Unfortunately the exhibit I wanted
to see had just been taken down and they were preparing for the next exhibit. As I sulked away I noticed
these pine cones which I've never seen before. I liked them a lot and decided to snap a picture. So while
one door was closed another was open. Do you like the pine cones?
