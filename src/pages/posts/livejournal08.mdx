_This post was recovered from an old livejournal blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

ell I applied to the blogging scholarship today hopefully I get something, but I'll have to wait until November to find out! Oh well my search continues for scholarships. I need more, more I say! If I'm to go to Japan this summer I need some more money for college, if you know any scholarships please let me know...

arigatou and sayonara,

Curtis
