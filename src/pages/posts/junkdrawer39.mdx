_This post was recovered from an old blog that I had while going to college at Oregon State University. I've only updated misspellings or dead links, but left any cringe worthy things or immature thoughts. I've decided to leave them as a snapshot of who I was and to see how far I've come. Any photos have been freshly edited and so are not the same as what was originally posted. Over the years I had several blogs, most lost to time, and I wanted to recover some lost memories and reflect on my life._

<DropCap letter='A' />

bove is a photo of my Goodwill Garden. The red lines indicate where a rock border is going to go, the blue is the compost pile, and in the bag are some coffee grounds. I figure that it’s safe enough to post this up now that I’ve been gardening there for a week or two without any complaints.

I’ve been constantly adding coffee grounds to try and get the soil in better shape. I just planted a few radish’s and i’m hoping to plant a ton more fall veggies. I don’t really have room to grow many veggies or plants so if your reading this and your in the Corvallis area and you have plants then contact me!

Yesterday I decided to go to the garden. Add some coffee grounds, pull some weeds, and pick up some trash. As the garden came into view I noticed a mattress. Someone had dumped some crap right next to the garden. I was a bit perturbed. Then I saw a van sitting in the empty lot. Was it the dumper? No just looked like someone hanging out. I ignored the van and got to work on the garden. Soon an elderly gentleman emerged from the back of the van. He was the typical older man except he was wearing headphones and listening to something on a CD. He looked in our direction, perplexed. What where these youngin’s doing? He came over and started to ask what we were up to. I gave him the spiel on growing a garden for the community and myself. Trying to make the city look better. He seemed interested and even offered to light our compost pile on fire with some matches. I declined explaining that the pile of dead plants and sticks would be compost for the garden.

After walking around a bit he started asking about me and if I went to school. We talked about books and the library. He made what he must of thought a convincing argument for “books on tape” or in his case “books on cd”. It’s not my thing, but I listened and asked what he was listening to. He walked to his van and dug through his pile of stuff and walked back over with book in hand. Cadillac Desert. I remembered the title for future checkout at the library. Packing up our tools and dusting ourselves off we left. Gone as quickly as we had came. I wonder what Mr. Cadillac Man thought?
