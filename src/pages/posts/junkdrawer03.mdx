I went to an event called “Empty Bowls” last Sunday. The event was held to benefit organizations helping stop world hunger. They had ceramic bowls from local artist which you could buy and then fill up with some soup. They also had some music playing from a country/bluegrass band.

Getting the Shot:
I went into the room with this event and sort of milled around for while. Then I decided to get some safe basic shots of athletes serving soup to people. Pretty standard and unexciting. Then I took some photos of the speakers and the band. For all the photos the SB-800 was being bounced of the ceiling to give a little more light and stop the motion of people moving around.

Equipment:
Nikon D300
Nikon SB-800
Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8
