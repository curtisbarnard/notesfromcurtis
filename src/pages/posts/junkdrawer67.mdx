Top 3 Videos (Week 2)
Friday, January 2nd, 2009

#3: This video is from BusanKevin over at YouTube. While the camerawork can be a bit shaky he takes us on a nice hike around the Osaka/Nara area.

The number two video this week is a short clip on Yakushima, an island in southern japan that contains ancient forest. Produced by NHK.

Unfortunately i canâ€™t embed my top video this week so you will just have to go over to OPB to watch it. This video is about going out and finding wild foods. From clams to weeds in a parking lot, there are a lot of fresh (and free!) ingredients to be had here in the pacific northwest.

Hope you enjoyed these videos. If you know of some other interesting videos please post a comment.
